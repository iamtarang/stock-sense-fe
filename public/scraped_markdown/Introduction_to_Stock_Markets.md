### 13.1 – Dig deeper

Congratulations! If you’ve read all the chapters and scrolled through the numerous comments in each chapter, then that means that you dont have a passing interest in stock markets but rather a genuine interest to learn and profit from the market.

I guess you are now warmed up to dig deeper!

The objective of the first module is to give you a quick hands-on introduction to the stock markets. In our endeavor to introduce the stock markets, we have carefully selected concepts you need to know, especially if you are new to markets.  At this point, it is a good sign if you have many unanswered questions. You will find your answers as we proceed to other modules.

Before we proceed further, you need to understand why we have so many different learning modules and how these modules are interrelated. Here are some of the modules that we will cover in Varsity.

### 13.2 – So many modules, how are they interrelated?

The idea of ‘Varsity at Zerodha’ is to create a repository of high-quality market-related educational content. The content will cover fundamental analysis, technical analysis, derivatives, trading strategies, risk management, financial modeling, etc. Each main topic is categorized as a module. So think of a module as reading a book with several chapters within.

You may wonder how each topic fits within the grand scheme. To help you get a perspective, let me ask you a question. To be successful in the markets, what, according to you, is the  single most important factor?  Success in markets is easily defined – if you make money consistently, you are successful, and if you don’t, you are not!

So if you were to answer this question for me, chances are you would think about risk management, discipline, market timing, access to information, etc., as the key to success in markets. While one cannot deny the importance of these factors, developing a point of view (POV) is even more compelling and primary.

A point of view is the art of developing a sense of direction on a stock or the index. If you think the stock is going up, your POV is bullish; hence you would be a buyer of the stock. Likewise, if you think a stock is going down, your POV is bearish; you would be a stock seller. Without a POV, you won’t know what to do in the market. Once you develop a POV, you add other elements like risk management, timing, macro & micro factors, etc., to improve the odds of your trade, but without a POV, you just can’t get started. For that reason, I’d consider developing POV as the most important factor.

Having said that, how do you develop a point of view? How do you figure out if the stock is going up or down?

One needs to develop a systematic approach to analyze the markets to develop a point of view. A few methods are using which you can figure out/ analyze what to buy or sell. They are:

1. Fundamental Analysis (FA)
1. Technical Analysis (TA)
1. Quantitative Analysis (QA)
1. Outside views

To give you a preview, here is a typical illustration of a trader’s thought process while developing a POV (whether to buy or sell stocks) based on a particular method of analysis –

FA-based POV  – The company’s quarterly numbers look impressive. The company has reported a 25% top-line and 15% bottom-line growth. The company’s guidance also looks positive. With all the fundamental factors aligned, the stock looks bullish; hence the stock is a buy.

TA-based POV –  The MACD indicator has turned bullish along with a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern; the stock is also trading at its support point, with that study, its short-term sentiment looks positive; therefore, the stocks are a buy.

QA-based POV –  With the recent up move, the stock’s price to earnings (PE) touched the 3 rd  standard deviation. There is only a 1% chance for the PE to breach the 3 rd  standard deviation. Hence, it is prudent to expect a reversion to mean the stock is a sell.

Outside view –  The analyst on TV recommends a buy on the stock; therefore, the stock is a buy.

The POV you take should always be based on your own analysis rather than an outsider’s view, as more often than not, one regrets taking action based on an outside view.

So after developing a POV, what does one generally do? Does the straightaway go and trade the point of view? Here is where the complexity of markets starts to kick in.

If the POV is bullish, you can choose to do one of the following:

1. Buy the stock in the spot market.
1. Buy the stock in the derivatives markets.
 
 Within derivatives, you can choose to buy the futures. 
 Or choose to trade via the options market.
 
 Within the options market, there are call options and put options. 
 You can combine call and put options to create a synthetic bullish trade.
1. Within derivatives, you can choose to buy the futures.
1. Or choose to trade via the options market.
 
 Within the options market, there are call options and put options. 
 You can combine call and put options to create a synthetic bullish trade.
1. Within the options market, there are call options and put options.
1. You can combine call and put options to create a synthetic bullish trade.

So what you choose to do after developing a POV is a different ball game.  Choosing the right instrument to trade that complements your POV is critical to profitable trading.

For example, if I’m extremely bullish on the stock from a 1-year perspective, I’m better off making a delivery trade. However, if I’m out rightly bullish on the stock from a short-term perspective (say one week), I’d rather choose a futures instrument to trade.

If I’m bullish with constraints attached (for example – I’m expecting the markets to bounce because of a great budget announcement, but I don’t want to risk much), it would be prudent to choose an option instrument.

So the message here is – the market participant should develop a point of view and complement the POV with the right trading instrument. A well-researched POV combined with the right instrument to trade is a perfect recipe for market success.

Also, by now, hopefully, you have got a sense of how all the different modules in “Varsity” play an important role in assimilating the market.

So keeping this in the background, go ahead and explore the content on  Varsity at Zerodha.

The next two modules will explore concepts that will help us develop POV based on Technical and Fundamental Analysis.

After reading through these two modules, you will get a sense of developing a point of view on markets. In the later modules, we will discuss the different trading instruments you can choose to complement your perspective. As we progress, we will ramp up the flow to help you start calibrating your trades with effective risk management techniques.

Let’s roll!



## 12.Key_Events_and_Their_Impact_on_Markets

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/key-events-and-their-impact-on-markets/)



### 12.1 – Events

Trading or investing based on just company-specific information may not be sufficient. Outside events, both economic and/or non-economic, impact stocks and the market’s performance in general. It is also important to understand the events that influence the markets.

In this chapter, we will try to understand some common events and how the stock market reacts to these events.




### 12.2 – Monetary Policy

The monetary policy is a tool through which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) controls the money supply by controlling the interest rates. RBI is India’s central bank. Likewise, every country’s central bank is responsible for setting interest rates. For example, the European Central Bank in Europe and Federal Reserves in the US. Central Banks tweak the interest rates to control the money supply in the mainstream economy.

While setting the interest rates, the RBI has to strike a balance between growth and inflation. In a nutshell – if the interest rates are high, the borrowing rates are high (particularly for corporations). If corporate can’t borrow easily, they cannot grow. If corporations don’t grow, the economy slows down.

On the other hand, borrowing becomes easier when the interest rates are low. This translates to more money in the hands of corporations and consumers. With more money, there is increased spending which means the sellers tend to increase the prices of goods and services, leading to inflation.

I’d encourage you to watch this YouTube video where I’ve tried to explain what causes inflation and the means through which RBI controls inflation.

To strike a balance, the RBI has to consider all economic factors and carefully set the key rates. Any imbalance in these rates can lead to economic chaos. The key RBI rates that you need to track are as follows:

Repo Rate  – Banks can borrow from the RBI. The rate at which RBI lends money to other banks is called the Repo Rate. If the repo rate is high, the cost of borrowing is high, leading to slow economic growth. You can check the latest repo rate (And other rates, too) on RBI’s  website . Markets don’t like the RBI increasing the repo rates because it slows down economic growth.

Reverse repo rate  – Reverse Repo rate is the rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. Or in other words, Reverse Repo is the deposit rate RBI offers to other banks when the banks park funds with RBI. When banks deposit money to RBI, they are certain that RBI will not default, so the rate RBI offers is relatively low. However, the banking system’s money supply reduces when banks deposit money with RBI (at a lower rate) instead of the corporate entity. An increase in the reverse repo rate is not great for the economy as it tightens the money supply. Sometimes via the central bank’s policy, the central bank mandates higher deposits by banks; again, this is a way to curtail excess money supply in the mainstream economy.

Cash reserve ratio (CRR) –  Every bank must maintain funds with RBI. The amount that they maintain is dependent on the CRR. If CRR increases, more money is sucked out of the mainstream economy, which is not good for the economy.

The monetary policy committee members meet regularly to review the economic situation and decide upon these key rates; hence keeping track of the monetary policy event is a must for any active trader. The first to react to rate decisions would be interest-rate sensitive stocks across various sectors such as – banks, automobiles, housing finance, real estate, metals, etc.




### 12.3 – Inflation

Inflation is a sustained increase in the general prices of goods and services. Increasing inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. All things being equal, if the cost of 1 KG of onion has increased from Rs.15 to Rs.20, this price increase is attributed to inflation. Inflation is inevitable, but a high inflation rate is not desirable as it could lead to economic uneasiness. A high level of inflation tends to send a bad signal to markets. Both the Government and RBI work towards reducing inflation to a manageable level. Inflation is generally measured using an index. If the inflation index increases by certain percentage points, it indicates rising inflation. Likewise, an index falling indicates inflation cooling off.

There are two inflation indices – The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Wholesale Price Index (WPI)  – The WPI indicates the movement in prices at the wholesale level. It captures the price change when goods are bought and sold wholesale. WPI is an easy and convenient method to calculate inflation. The inflation measured here is at an institutional level and does not necessarily capture the consumer’s inflation.

Consumer Price Index   (CPI) – The CPI, on the other hand, captures the effect of the change in prices at a retail level. As a consumer, CPI inflation is what matters. The calculation of CPI is quite detailed as it involves classifying consumption into various categories and subcategories across urban and rural regions. Each of these categories is made into an index, the final CPI index is a composition of several internal indices. The CPI captures the effect of inflation on daily household consumables like fruits, vegetables, cereals, and even fuels like petrol and diesel.

The computation of CPI is quite rigorous and detailed. It is one of the most critical metrics for studying the economy.  A national statistical agency, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), publishes the CPI numbers around the 2 nd  week of every month. The RBI’s challenge is to strike a balance between inflation and interest rates. Usually, a low-interest rate tends to increase inflation, and a high-interest rate tends to arrest inflation.




### 12.4 – Index of Industrial Production (IIP)

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP)  is a short-term indicator of the country’s industrial sector’s progress. The data is released every month (along with inflation data) by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). As the name suggests, the IIP measures the Indian industrial sectors’ production, keeping a fixed reference point. As of today, India uses the reference point of 2004-05. The reference point is also called the base year.

Roughly about 15 different industries submit their production data to the ministry, which collates the data and releases it as an index number. If the IIP increases, it indicates a vibrant industrial environment (as the production is going up) and hence a positive sign for the economy and markets. A decreasing IIP indicates a sluggish production environment, hence a negative sign for the economy and markets.

To sum up, an upswing in industrial production is good for the economy, and a downswing rings an alarm. As India is getting more industrialized, the relative importance of the Index of Industrial Production is increasing.

A lower IIP number puts pressure on the RBI to lower the interest rates and aid industrial credit with cheaper credit.




### 12.5 – Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)

The Purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is an economic indicator that tries to capture business activity across the country’s manufacturing and service sectors. This is a survey-based indicator where the respondents – usually the purchasing managers- indicate their business perception change concerning the previous month. A separate survey is conducted for the service and manufacturing sectors. The data from the survey are consolidated on a single index. Typical areas covered in the survey include new orders, output, business expectations, and employment.

The PMI number usually oscillates around 50. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and below 50 indicates a contraction in the economy. And reading at 50 indicates no change in the economy.




### 12.6 – Budget

A Budget is an event during which the Ministry of Finance discusses the country’s finance in detail. The Finance Minister, on behalf of the ministry, makes a budget presentation to the entire country. During the budget, major policy announcements and economic reforms are announced, which impacts various industries across the markets. Therefore the budget plays a vital role in the economy.

To illustrate this further, in one of the recent budgets, the expectation was to increase the duties on a cigarette. As expected, during the budget, the Finance Minister raised the duties on a cigarette, so the prices increased. An increased cigarette price has a few implications:

1. Increased cigarette prices discourage smokers from buying cigarettes (needless to say, this is debatable), and hence the profitability of the cigarette manufacturing companies such as ITC decreases. If the profitability decreases, investors may want to sell shares of ITC. 
 If market participants start selling ITC, the markets will come down because ITC is an index heavyweight.

1. If market participants start selling ITC, the markets will come down because ITC is an index heavyweight.

In reaction to the budget announcement, ITC traded 3.5% lower for this precise reason.

A budget is an annual event, and it is announced during the last week of February. However, the budget announcement could be delayed under certain special circumstances, such as a new government formation.




### 12.7 – Corporate Earnings Announcement

Corporate earning season is perhaps one of the important events to which the stocks react. The listed companies (trading on the stock exchange) must declare their earnings once every quarter, also called the quarterly earnings numbers. During an earnings announcement, the corporate gives out details on various operational activities, including:

1. Revenue growth 
 Expense trend 
 Finance charges 
 Profitability trends 
 Project updates 
 Key trends in the industry
1. Revenue growth
1. Expense trend
1. Finance charges
1. Profitability trends
1. Project updates
1. Key trends in the industry

Besides, some companies give an overview of what to expect from the upcoming quarters. This forecast is called ‘corporate guidance.’

Invariably every quarter, the first blue-chip company to make the quarterly announcement is Infosys Limited. They also give out guidance regularly. Market participants follow what Infosys has to say regarding guidance as it impacts the markets.

The table below gives you an overview of the earning season in India:


Sl No | Months | Quarter | Result Announcement
--- | --- | --- | ---
01 | April to June | Quarter 1 (Q1) | 1st week of July
02 | July to September | Quarter 2 (Q2) | 1st week of Oct
03 | October to December | Quarter 3 (Q3) | 1st Week of Jan
04 | January to March | Quarter 4 (Q4) | 1st Week of April


Do note that the 1st of April in India marks the beginning of the financial year. In the US, the financial year starts on 1st Jan, so the first quarter starts from January through March, and so forth.

Every quarter when the company declares its earnings, the market participants match the earnings with their expectations of how much the company should have earned. The market participant’s expectation is called the ‘street expectation.’

The stock price will react positively if the company’s earnings are better than the street expectations. The stock price will react negatively if the actual numbers are lower than the street expectation.

If the street expectation and actual numbers match, the stock price tends to trade flat with a negative bias more often than not. This is mainly because the company could not give any positive surprises.




### 12.8 – Non Financial events

Apart from the events we discussed above, it would be best to watch out for other non-financial events to understand their impact on markets. For example, the Covid crisis of 2020 had a significant effect on economies around the world, disrupting the world economic order. The supply chain took a hit across the globe leading to an inflation spike. That said, there were select pockets of the economy that did very well, mainly the online services industry.

Events like the Russia – Ukraine war or the tension between China and Taiwan have impacted world markets. Geo-political affairs such as these impact various connected economies. For instance, the war between Russia and Ukraine affects the supply of natural gas and crude oil, which significantly impacts the energy costs in Europe.

As an active trader or a market participant, you need to watch out for these events and understand how these events can impact the markets.

While the world economies are interconnected, isolated events (Country specific) impact the local economy. For example, the elections in India impact only the Indian economy.

So, keep an eye on these non-financial events and how they can impact the stock markets or sometimes specific industries.

Key takeaways from this chapter

1. Markets and individual stocks react to events. Market participants should equip themselves to understand and decipher these events.
1. Monetary policy is one of the most important economic events. During the monetary policy, review actions on a repo, reverse repo, CRR etc. are initiated.
1. Interest rates and inflation are related. Increasing interest rates curbs inflation and vice versa
1. Inflation data is released every month by MOSPI. As a consumer, CPI inflation data is what you need to track.
1. IIP measures industrial production activity. An increase in IIP cheers the markets, and a lower IIP disappoints the market.
1. PMI is a survey-based business sentiment indicator. The PMI number oscillates around 50 marks. Above 50 is good news to markets, and PMI below 50 is not.
1. The Budget is an important market event where policy announcements and reform initiatives are taken. Markets and stocks react strongly to budget announcements.
1. Corporate earnings are reported every quarter. Stocks react mainly due to the variance in actual number versus the street’s expectation.
1. Keep an eye on non-financial events and how they can impact the markets.



## 11.Corporate_actions_and_impact_on_stock_prices

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/five-corporate-actions-and-its-impact-on-stock-prices/)



### 11.1 – Corporate Actions

Corporate actions are financial initiatives undertaken by a company that results in a change to its stock price. There are different corporate actions that an entity can choose to initiate. A good understanding of these corporate actions gives a clear picture of the company’s financial health and determines whether to buy or sell a particular stock.

This chapter will examine the five most important corporate actions and their impact on stock prices. A corporate action is initiated by the board of directors and approved by the company’s shareholders.




### 11.2 – Dividends

Dividends are portions of profits made by the company, which are distributed to the company’s shareholders. Dividends are paid on a per-share basis. For example, Infosys recently declared a dividend of Rs.42/- per share, which means you get Rs.42/- as dividend income for every share you own. Suppose you own 100 Infosys shares; you can get 100*42 = Rs.4,200/- as dividend income. The company directly remits the dividends to your bank account (linked to your Demat account). The dividend paid is also expressed as a percentage of the face value. In the above case, the face value of Infosys is Rs.5/-, and the dividend paid was Rs.42/- hence the dividend payout is said to be 840% (42/5).

It is not mandatory to pay dividends every year. If the company feels that instead of paying dividends to shareholders, they are better off utilizing the same cash to fund a new project for a better future, they can do so. Typically, companies in the growth phase (young companies growing fast) choose not to pay dividends but rather to plow back the profits into the business for more growth. However, when the company’s growth opportunities slow down and it holds excess cash, it would make sense to reward its shareholders via dividends. Cash with shareholders makes more sense than retaining the cash on the company’s book, and distributing the dividends may be the best way forward for the company.

The dividends need not be paid from the profits alone. If the company has made a loss during the year but it holds a healthy cash reserve, it can still pay dividends from its cash reserves.

The company’s board members at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) decide whether to pay a dividend. The dividends are not paid right after the announcement. This is because the shares are traded throughout the year, and it would be difficult to identify who is eligible to receive dividends and who isn’t. The following timeline would help you understand the dividend cycle.

Dividend Declaration Date:  This is the date on which the AGM takes place, and the company’s board approves the dividend issue

Record Date:  The date the company decides to review the shareholder’s register to list all eligible shareholders for the dividend. Usually, the time difference between the dividend declaration date and the record date is 30 days.

Ex-Date/Ex-Dividend date:  With the T+1 settlement cycle, the ex-dividend date normally is on the same day as the record date. Only shareholders who own the shares before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend. This is because, in India, the equity settlement is on a T+1 basis. So for all practical purposes, if you want to be entitled to receive a dividend, you need to ensure you buy the shares before the ex-dividend date.

Dividend Payout Date:  The date on which the dividends are paid to shareholders listed in the company register.

Cum Dividend : The shares are said to be cum dividends till the ex-dividend date.

When the stock goes ex-dividend, usually, the stock drops to the extent of dividends paid. For example, if ITC (trading at Rs. 335) has declared a dividend of Rs.15. On ex-date, the stock price will drop to the extent of the dividend paid, and as in this case, the price of ITC will drop down to Rs.320. The reason for this price drop is that the dividend amount paid no longer sits on the company’s balance sheet; hence the stock price is adjusted. From the balance sheet perspective, dividends paid are considered cash out. Hence the new stock price has to factor in the shrunk balance sheet. Hence the price drops. That said, you will not always notice a significant price drop in the share price.

Sometimes, the company pays out a special dividend. A special dividend is non-recurring and happens on a ‘one-time basis.’ The special dividends are usually very large payments compared to a regular dividend, and that’s when the stock price significantly drops. The drop in stock price should not be considered negative as you would receive a cash payment as a shareholder.

Lastly, dividends can be paid anytime during the financial year. If it’s paid during the financial year, it is called the interim dividend. If the dividend is paid at the end of the financial year, it is called the final dividend.




### 11.3 – Bonus Issue

A bonus issue is a stock dividend allotted by the company to reward the shareholders. In regular dividends, cash is paid out to shareholders, but in a bonus issue, stocks are paid out instead of cash. The bonus shares are issued out of the reserves of the company. The shareholders receive these free shares against shares they currently hold. These allotments typically come in a fixed ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, etc. In a bonus issue, the stock price declines to the extent of the bonus ratio, but this decline should not be mistaken for a correction in stock price or a fall.

If the ratio is 2:1, the existing shareholders get two additional shares for every share they hold at no additional cost. So if a shareholder owns 100 shares, 200 additional shares will be rewarded. The total holding after the bonus issue will become 300 shares. When the bonus shares are issued, the number of shares the shareholder holds will increase, but an investment’s overall value will remain the same.

To illustrate this, let us assume a bonus issue on different ratios – 1:1, 3:1 and 5:1


Bonus Issue | No. of shares held before bonus. | Share price before Bonus issue | Value of Investment | No. of shares post Bonus. | Share price after Bonus issue | Value of Investment
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1:1 | 100 | 75 | 7,500 | 200 | 37.5 | 7500
3:1 | 30 | 550 | 16,500 | 120 | 137.5 | 16,500
5:1 | 2000 | 15 | 30,000 | 12,000 | 2.5 | 30,000


So as you see, in a bonus issue, only the number of shares increases, and your investment value remains the same before and after the bonus issue.

The bonus announcement date, ex-bonus date, and record date are similar to the dividend issue.

Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation, especially when the company’s price per share is very high, and it becomes tough for new investors to buy shares. The number of outstanding shares increases by issuing bonus shares, but the share price is slashed, as shown in the example above.

Think about this – fewer retail participants can buy or sell that share if the share price is bloated (I mean just the per-share price here, not the valuation). For example, the share price of MRF Limited is in the region of Rs.90,000 per share. A retail investor has to shell out 90K to buy and invest in 1 share, and this also means a small retail investor, with, say, Rs.25,000 to invest, can never buy MRF. Many retail investors spread the risk across 100s and 1000s of investors as opposed to a few investors. Hence, when the stock price bloats, companies issue a bonus share to slash the stock price without impacting any other financial metric, which is one reason to issue a bonus share.

Why isn’t MRF splitting the shares, then? Well, at the end of the day, the decision is solely dependent on the company and I guess MRF is yet to make up their mind or perhaps they just wont indulge in these corporate actions 🙂




### 11.4 – Stock Split

The word stock split sounds weird, but this happens regularly in the markets. What this means is quite literally – the stocks that you hold are split!

Similar to a bonus issue, when the company declares a stock split, the number of shares held increases, but the investment value remains the same. The big difference between a bonus and a split is that in the bonus issue, the face value of the company remains unchanged, but in a stock split, the face value changes. Suppose the stock’s face value is Rs.10, and there is a 1:2 stock split, then the face value will change to Rs.5. If you owned one share before the split, you would now own two shares after the split.

We will illustrate this with an example:


Split Ratio | Old FV | No. of shares you own before split | Share Price before split | Investment Value before split | New FV | No. of shares you own after the split | Share Price after the split | Investment value after the split
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1:2 | 10 | 100 | 900 | 90,000 | 5 | 200 | 450 | 90,000
1:5 | 10 | 100 | 900 | 90,000 | 2 | 500 | 180 | 90,000


Like a bonus issue, a stock split encourages more retail participation by reducing the value per share. The dates and timeline (announcement date, ex-date, record date, etc.) are similar to dividend and bonus issues.




### 11.5 – Rights Issue

The idea behind a rights issue is to raise fresh capital. However, instead of going public, the company approaches its existing shareholders. Think about the rights issue as a second IPO and a select group of people (existing shareholders). The rights issue  could indicate  promising new development in the company, but this is not always true. As an investor, you need to evaluate the reasons for the right issue and determine if it makes sense. The shareholders can subscribe to the rights issue in the proportion of their shareholding. For example, 1:4 rights issue means for every four shares; the shareholder can subscribe to 1 additional share. The new shares under the rights issue will be issued at a lower price than what prevails in the markets. For example, if a stock is trading at Rs.500 per share, then the right issue could be at a 20% discount, at Rs.400 per share.

However, a word of caution – The investor should not be swayed by the company’s discount, but they should look beyond that. A rights issue is different from a bonus issue as one is paying money to acquire shares. Hence the shareholder should subscribe only if he or she is completely convinced about the company’s future. It can so happen that after the company announces the right issue, the stock price can go below the right issue price. If the market price is below the subscription price/right issue price, it is cheaper to buy it from the open market.




### 11.6 – Buyback of shares

A buyback can be seen as a company’s method to invest in itself by buying shares from other investors in the market. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding in the market; however, the buyback of shares is an important corporate restructuring method. There could be many reasons why corporates choose to buy back shares…

1. Improve the profitability on a per-share basis
1. To consolidate their stake in the company.
1. To prevent other companies from taking over.
1. To show the confidence of the promoters about their company.
1. To support the share price from declining in the markets.

When a company announces a buyback, it signals the company’s confidence in itself. Hence this is usually positive for the share price, but like other things in the market, always evaluate the reasons for the corporate action.

1. Corporate actions have an impact on stock prices.
1. Dividends are a means of rewarding shareholders. The dividend is announced as a percentage of the face value.
1. You must own the stock before the ex-dividend date to get the dividend.
1. A bonus issue is a form of stock dividend. This is the company’s way of rewarding the shareholders with additional shares.
1. A stock split is done based on the face value. The face value and the stock price change in proportion to the change in face value
1. A rights issue is how the company raises fresh capital from the existing shareholders. Subscribe to it only if you think it makes sense
1. Buyback signals a positive outlook for the promoters. This also conveys to the shareholders that the promoters are optimistic about the company’s prospects.

### 10.1 – Market structure

The topic of clearing and settlement is super important to understand as it gives you a sense of the movement of money and funds between your account and, let’s just say, the stock market. For instance, when you buy a stock, say 100 shares of Marico, you need to clearly understand how long it takes for the broker to remit these 100 Marico shares to your Demat account. We can extend this to stock selling as well.

The lack of understanding of the clearing and settlement process could leave a void and leave you with many unanswered questions related to the market structure. Hence, for this reason, we will explore what happens behind the scenes from when you buy a stock to when it hits your DEMAT account.

We will keep this discussion practical with a clear emphasis on what you need to know about clearing and settlement.




### 10.2 – What happens when you buy a stock?

Day 1 – The trade (T Day), Monday

Assume on a Monday, you buy 100 shares of Reliance Industries at Rs.1,000/- per share. The total buy value is Rs.1,00,000/- (100 * 1000). The day you make the transaction is the trade date; brokers refer to this as the ‘T Day.’  The assumption is that you intend to hold Reliance Industries in your Demat account for a few days or maybe years, and it is not an intraday trade.

When you place an order to buy, the broker quickly validates if you have the necessary funds. In this example, the order will go through only if you have Rs.1,00,000/- in your trading account; it will be rejected otherwise. Assuming the trade is executed through Zerodha, the applicable charges are –


Sl No | Chargeable Item | Applicable Charges | Amount
--- | --- | --- | ---
01 | Brokerage | Zero for Equity Delivery. For intraday, charges are 0.03% or Rs.20/- whichever is lower, per executed order | Zero
02 | Security Transaction Charges(STT) | 0.1% of the turnover | 100/-
03 | Exchange transaction Charges | 0.00345% of the turnover | 3.45/-
04 | GST | 18% of Brokerage + Transaction charges + SEBI charges | 0.62/-
07 | SEBI Charges | Rs.10 per crore of transaction | 0.12/-
Total | 104.19/-


Additionally, Rs.15/- towards stamp duty is applicable. Stamp duty is charged at 0.015% on the buy side. Hence the total applicable charges are  Rs.119.19 . Note that these rates are subject to change; you can visit  Zerodha’s Brokerage calculator  to figure out the exact applicable rate when you wish to carry out a transaction.

So an amount of Rs.1,00,000 plus 119.19 totaling Rs.1,00,119.19/- is required to carry out this particular transaction. Remember, the money is blocked in your account when you place a trade, but the stock is yet to hit your DEMAT account.

Also, on the T day, the broker generates a ‘contract note’ and emails you the copy to your registered email id.  A contract note is like a bill detailing all your daily transactions. You can save the contract note for future reference. A contract note gives you a break up of all daily transactions and the trade reference number. It also shows the breakup of charges charged by the broker.

Day 2 – Trade Day + 1 (T+1 day, Tuesday)

Starting January 2023, India became the first country to implement a T+1 settlement for all the scrips listed on the stock exchanges. Earlier when you used to buy the shares, these would be delivered to your demat account on T+2 day. For example, if you bought shares on Monday, these will be credited to your demat account only on Wednesday. With T+1 settlement, if you buy shares on Monday, they will be credited to your demat account on Tuesday, the next day itself.

So on Day 2, also called T+1, the settlement is due to the exchange. Assuming the purchaser and seller are trading via two different brokers, the funds are debited from the buyer’s broker’s pool account by the clearing corporation and credited to the selling broker’s pool account. Also, on T+1 day, the shares will reflect in the purchaser’s DEMAT account, indicating that you own 100 shares of Reliance.




### 10.3 – What happens when you sell a stock?

The day you sell the stocks is again referred to as the ‘T Day’. The stock gets blocked when you sell the stock from your DEMAT account, and by the end of the day, the stocks are ‘earmarked’ for settlement. Please refer to the next section to learn more about earmarking.

Before the T+1 day, the earmarked shares are delivered to the depository. On settlement day, the blocked shares are debited from your demat account and moved to the clearing corporation for payin. Against the debit of such shares, you’d have received a credit for the sale after deducting all charges. You may be interested to note that you will receive 80% of the funds on T-Day and the remaining 20% on T+1. In other words, the seller will be settled fully on a T+1 basis, just like how the buyer is settled.

What transpires between T day and T+1 is a complex settlement process involving the stockbroker, clearing corporation, depository, and the stock exchange. Each entity uploads and receives multiple files to ensure the transaction goes smoothly. As far as you are concerned, you need to remember that equity transactions are settled on a T+1 basis, meaning, if you are a buyer, you will get the shares on T+1, and if you are a seller, the funds are credited on a T+1 basis.




### 10.4 – What is earmarking?

Earlier, for the settlement of a sell trade, the broker would be required to debit shares from a selling client, hold the securities in the broker’s pool account, and transfer the securities to the clearing corporation (CC) on T+2. Upon transfer, the client would receive a credit of funds against the sale, and the transaction would have been said to be settled. It was usual practice for brokers to debit shares on T day or T+1 day and transfer it to CC on T+2 (since the settlement was on T+2).

From the time the shares were debited until they were settled, the client shares lie in the broker’s pool account, possibly allowing a broker to misuse these securities. SEBI identified this as a potential risk and introduced “earmarking” for settlement. In this new earmarking system, shares are no longer debited from the client’s account; they are only earmarked for settlement. Think of earmarking as a temporary hold on the securities towards an upcoming settlement for the sale transaction initiated by the client.

On settlement day, the shares are debited from the investor’s account and credited to the clearing corporation. This new process eliminates the need for brokers to hold client shares in their pool account, thereby eliminating the risk that comes along. The new earmarking process has been made mandatory from November 2022.

1. The day you make a transaction, the trade date is referred to as the ‘T Day.’
1. The broker must issue you a contract note for all transactions by the end of T day.
1. When you buy a share, the same will be reflected in your DEMAT account by the end of T+1 day.
1. All equity/stock settlements in India happen on a T+1 basis.
1. When you sell shares, the shares are blocked immediately, and the sale proceeds are credited again on T+1 day.
1. Earmarking of shares was introduced to ensure the securities don’t move out of the client’s demat account to the broker’s pool account.



## 9.The_Trading_Terminal

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-trading-terminal/)



### 9.1 – Trading Terminal

Over the last few chapters, we have understood several things related to the stock markets. It is time for us to figure out how one can actually transact in the stock markets. There are three options available for you to place a transaction in the stock market –

1. Call your stocks broker (usually on the central support number), and request to buy or sell a stock; this is called “Call & Trade.” 
 Use a web application 
 Use a mobile application
1. Call your stocks broker (usually on the central support number), and request to buy or sell a stock; this is called “Call & Trade.”
1. Use a web application
1. Use a mobile application

Regardless of which method you choose, the selected method gives you access to the stock market. Think of this access as a gateway. The gateway allows you to do multiple things, such as transact in shares, track your Profit & Loss, track market movements, manage your funds, view stock charts, access trading tools, etc. This chapter aims to familiarize you with this gateway, also called a ‘Trading terminal’. To explain this chapter, I’ll use Zerodha’s trading terminal called ‘Kite.’ If you are with another broker, then the trading terminal provided to you will have (should have) similar features and functionality.

You can access the trading terminal by entering the URL on your browser.  For Zerodha Kite, it is kite.zerodha.com.  To access the trading terminal, you must have a trading account with your broker. A good trading terminal offers many features. We will start by understanding a few basic features. Let us set two basic tasks, and we will accomplish them using the trading terminal, and in the process, we learn the basics practically. Here are the two tasks –

1. Buy one share of ITC, and 
 Track the price of Infosys
1. Buy one share of ITC, and
1. Track the price of Infosys

While we achieve the above two tasks, we will also learn about all the relevant concepts.




### 9.2 – The login process

The trading terminal is quite sensitive as it contains information about all your securities and funds. SEBI has been working hard to ensure the relevant regulations are in place to prevent situations where access to the client’s trading terminal is compromised. To ensure adequate security, brokers have to follow a stringent login process. The process involves entering your broker-provided user ID (it’s referred to as the Kite ID in Zerodha), and a password.

Once you click login, the user id and password are authenticated, and then you are prompted to enter an external TOTP (Time based one-time password). TOTPs, as the name suggests, are time sensitive and keep changing once in a few seconds.  TOTPs can be set up using 3rd party authentication software like Google authenticator or Authy.

Once you validate the TOTP, you will instantly get access to your trading account. I’d encourage you to  read this article  to learn about TOTP, the general login process, and the need to safeguard your trading account.




### 9.3 – The Market watch

Once you successfully log in to the platform, you must populate the ‘market watch’ with the stocks you are interested in. Think about the market watch as a blank slate. Once the stock is loaded on the market watch, you can easily transact and query information about it. A blank market watch looks like this (this is also the screen that you see once you log in)

The 600.2 under equity and 136.75 under commodities indicate my fund balance. So 600 Rupees for Equity (to buy and sell stocks), and 136 Rupees to buy commodities. You can add funds from your bank to your trading account or withdraw funds from your trading account back to your bank account by clicking on the fund tab on top.

Alright, let us work on the first task, i.e., to buy one share of ITC. As a first step, we will load ITC Ltd onto the market watch. To do this, we have to search for ITC in the search bar, and the drop-down will show the stock in different exchanges(NSE/BSE).

You only need to look for ‘ITC’; other instruments, like ITC-BE, ITC-BL, or ITC6, are all different instruments. We will discuss more of that later. We are interested in buying one share of ITC (or ITC stock), and the relevant instrument is ITC. So let us click on the ‘Add symbol’ to add the stock to the Market Watch

The Marketwatch will display the last traded price, a percentage change of the stock.

- The last traded price of the stock (LTP) – This gives us a sense of how much the stock is trading at the very moment.
- Percentage change – This indicates the percentage change in the LTP with respect to the previous day’s close.

Some basic information that will be needed at this point would be:

- The previous day’s close – As the name suggests, it’s the previous day’s close price.
- OHLC – Open, High, Low, and Close give us a sense of the range within which the stock is trading during the day. Do recollect we discussed OHLC in the previous chapter.
- Volumes – Gives a sense of how many shares are being traded at a particular time.

You can find this information under Market Depth. If you hover over the stock name from the left, you will find Buy, Sell, Market Depth, and chart options. If you click on Marketdepth, you will find the above information, including the best bid and offer price ladder. We will cover the Bid and Offer prices soon.

As you can see, the last traded price of ITC is Rs.262.25, and it is trading -0.40% lower than the previous day’s close, which was Rs.263.30. The open for the day was at Rs.265.90, the highest price and the lowest price at which the stock traded for the day was Rs.265.90 and Rs.262.15 respectively. The volume for the day is close to 27 lakh shares.




### 9.4 – Buying stock through the trading terminal

Our goal is to buy one share of ITC. We now have ITC in our trading terminal. The first step for this process would be to invoke what is called a buy order form.

- Hover over the stock you want to Buy and click on the Buy Icon (B) 
 Clicking on the Buy icon invokes the buy order form, as seen below
- Hover over the stock you want to Buy and click on the Buy Icon (B)
- Clicking on the Buy icon invokes the buy order form, as seen below

The order form is pre-populated with some information like the price and quantity. We need to modify this as per our requirements. Let us begin with the first drop-down option on the top. By default, the exchange specified would be NSE, but you can select BSE if you wish.

The next entry is the ‘order type.’ By clicking on the drop-down menu, you will see the following four options:

- Limit 
 Market 
 SL 
 SL-Market
- Limit
- Market
- SL
- SL-Market

Let us understand what these options mean.

You can opt for a ‘ Limit ’ order when you are particular about the price you want to pay for a stock. In our case, the last traded price of ITC is Rs.262.25 but say we want to limit our buy price to Rs.261, twenty-five paisa lower than the LTP. In such a situation, I can use the limit feature and specify the price at which I want to buy the stock. The limit feature is great as it gives us control over the price at which we want to buy, but on the flip side, if the stock price does not fall to our limit price, i.e., 261, our order will not get executed, and we won’t get to buy. This is one of the drawbacks of a limit order. The limit order stays valid till the market closes, i.e., 3:30 PM, and then gets canceled.

You can also opt for a  market order  when you intend to buy at market-available prices instead of a limited price. So if you were to place a market order, as long as sellers are available, your order would go through, and ITC will be bought in and around Rs.262.25. Suppose the price goes up to Rs.265 coinciding with your market order placement, then you will get ITC at Rs.265. When you place a market order, you will never be sure of the price at which you will transact, which could be quite dangerous if you are an active trader. A market order will always ensure your order goes through, unlike a limit order.

A stop-loss order  protects you from an adverse movement in the market after initiating a position. Suppose you buy ITC at Rs.262.25 with an expectation that ITC will hit Rs.275 shortly. But instead, what if the price of ITC starts going down? We can protect our position by defining the worst possible loss you are willing to take. For instance, in the example, let us assume you don’t want to take a loss beyond Rs.255

This means you have gone long on ITC at Rs.262.25, and the maximum loss you will take on this trade is Rs.6 (255). If the stock price drops to Rs.255, the stop loss order gets active and hits the exchange, and you will be out of the loss-making position. If the price is above 255, the stop-loss order will be dormant.

A stop-loss order is a passive order. To activate it, we need to enter a trigger price. A trigger price, usually above the stop-loss price, acts as a price threshold, and only after crossing this price does the stop-loss order transition from a passive order to an active order.

Going with the above example:

We are long at Rs.261. If the trade goes bad, we want to get rid of the position at Rs.255. Therefore 255 is the stop-loss price. The trigger price is specified so the stop-loss order would transition from passive to active. The trigger price has to be higher (or equal) to the stop-loss price. We can set this to Rs.255 or higher.  If the price drops below 255, the stop loss order gets active.

Returning to the main buy order entry form, we move directly to the quantity once the order type is selected. Remember the task is to buy one share of ITC; hence we enter 1 in the quantity box. We ignore the trigger price and disclosed quantity for now. The next thing to select is the product type.

Select CNC for delivery trades. If you intend to buy and hold the shares for multiple days/months/years, you must ensure the shares reside in your Demat account. Selecting CNC is your way of communicating this to your broker.

Select MIS if you want to trade intraday. MIS is a margin product; we will understand more about this when we take up the derivatives module.

Once these details are filled in your order form, the order is good to hit the markets. The order gets transmitted to the exchange as soon as you press the submit button on the order form. A unique order ticket number is generated against your order.

Once the order is sent to the exchange, it will not get executed unless the price hits Rs.261. As soon as the price drops to Rs.261 (assuming sellers are willing to sell one share), your order gets through and is eventually executed. As soon as your order is executed, you will own one share of ITC.




### 9.5 – The order book and Trade book

Think of the order book and trade book as online registers within the trading terminal. The order book keeps track of all the orders you have sent to the exchange, and the trade book tracks all the trades. Think of it this way – when you order goods on Amazon, you first add items to the cart. The cart is the order book. You can add items, delete, or modify the order from the cart (order book). But when you press the buy button on Amazon, the order gets placed, and a receipt is generated. The trade book is that receipt. You also get a detailed receipt emailed to you called a ‘Contract Note’; we will discuss that later; for now think about the trade book as a general receipt for all the trades you carry out on the terminal.

So the order book has all the details regarding your order. You can navigate to the order book by clicking the Orders tab.

The order book provides the details of the orders you have placed. You should access the order book to:

- Double-check the order details – quantity, price, order type, product type 
 Modify the orders – For example, if you want to modify the buy order, say from 261 to 259. 
 Check Status – After placing the order, you can check the status. The status would state open if the order is completed partially, it would state completed if the order has been completed, and it would state rejected if your order has been rejected. You can also see the details of the rejection in the order book.
- Double-check the order details – quantity, price, order type, product type
- Modify the orders – For example, if you want to modify the buy order, say from 261 to 259.
- Check Status – After placing the order, you can check the status. The status would state open if the order is completed partially, it would state completed if the order has been completed, and it would state rejected if your order has been rejected. You can also see the details of the rejection in the order book.

If you notice, there is an open order to buy one share of ITC at Rs.261.

If you hover over the pending orders, you can find the option to modify or cancel the order.

By clicking ‘modify,’ the order form will be invoked, and you can make the desired changes to the order.

Once the order is processed, and the trade has been executed, the trade details will be available in the trade book. You can find the trade book just below the order book.

Here is a snapshot of the trade book:

The trade book confirms that the user ordered to buy one share of ITC at Rs 262.2. Also, notice a unique exchange order number is generated for the trade.

So with this, our first task is complete!

We now officially own one share of ITC. This share will reside in our DEMAT account until you decide to sell it.

The next task is to track the price of Infosys. The first step would be to add Infosys to the market watch. We can do this by searching for Infosys in the search box.

Once we select Infy, we press add to add it to the market watch.

Notice we have two stocks on the watchlist now – Infy and ITC. We can now track live price information on Infosys. The last trade price is Rs.1014.75; the stock is down -0.11% from its previous day’s close of Rs.1015.85. Infosys opened the day at Rs.1014.80, making a low of Rs.998.40 and a high of Rs.1028.95. The volumes were 3.6 million shares.

Please note while the open price will be fixed at Rs. 1014.80, the high and low prices change as and when the price of Infosys changes. For example, if Infosys moves from Rs.1014.2 to Rs.1050, the high price will reflect Rs. 1050 as the new high.

Notice below that the LTP of Infosys is in green, and ITC is in red. The cell is highlighted in green if the current LTP is higher than the previous close, and red otherwise.

Have a look at the snapshot below:

While writing this chapter, the price of Infosys moved from 1014.20 to 1020.80, and the color changed to red from blue.

Besides the basic information about the LTP, OHLC, and volume, we can also dig deeper to understand real-time market participation, which is available in market depth. I want to draw your attention to the blue and red numbers called the Bid and Offer prices.




### 9.6 – The Bid and Offer Price

If you want to buy a share, you need to buy it from a seller. The seller will offer the shares at a price that he or she thinks is fair. The price that the seller offers you is called the ‘ Offer Price.’  The offer price is highlighted in red. Let us analyze this in a bit more detail.


Sl No | Offer Price | Offer Quantity | Number of Sellers
--- | --- | --- | ---
01 | 3294.80 | 2 | 2
02 | 3294.85 | 4 | 2
03 | 3295.00 | 8 | 2
04 | 3296.20 | 25 | 1
05 | 3296.25 | 5 | 1


By default, the market depth window displays the top 5 bids and offer prices. In the table above, we have the top 5 offer prices.

The first offer price is Rs.3294.80. At this particular moment, this is the best price to buy the stock and there are only two shares available at this price being offered by two different sellers (both of them are selling one share each). The next best price is Rs.3294.85. At this price, four shares are offered by two different sellers. The third best price is Rs.3295, at which eight shares are available, and two sellers offer this. So on and so forth.

As you notice, the higher the asking price, the lower the priority. For example, the 5 th  position is an asking price of Rs.3296.25 for five shares. This is because the stock exchanges prioritize sellers willing to offer their shares at the lowest possible price.

Notice that even if you want to buy ten shares at Rs.3294.8, you can only buy two shares because only two are being offered at Rs.3294.8. However, if you are not particular about the price (aka limit price), you can place a market order. When you place a market order to buy 10 shares, this is how it will go –

- Two shares are bought @ Rs.3294.8 
 Four shares are bought @ Rs.3294.85 
 Four shares are bought @ Rs.3295.00
- Two shares are bought @ Rs.3294.8
- Four shares are bought @ Rs.3294.85
- Four shares are bought @ Rs.3295.00

The ten shares will be bought at three different prices. Also, in the process, the LTP of Infosys will jump to Rs.3295 from Rs.3294.8

If you want to sell a share, you need to sell it to a buyer willing to buy it from you. The buyer will buy the shares at a price that they thinks is fair. The price that the buyer expects is called the ‘bid price.’ The bid price is highlighted in blue. Let us analyze this part in a bit more detail:


Sl No | Bid Price | Bid Quantity | Number of Buyers
--- | --- | --- | ---
01 | 3294.75 | 10 | 5
02 | 3294.20 | 6 | 1
03 | 3294.15 | 1 | 1
04 | 3293.85 | 6 | 1
05 | 3293.75 | 125 | 1


Again by default, the market depth window displays the top five bid prices. Notice the best price at which you can sell shares is Rs.3294.75, and at this price, you can only sell ten shares as only five buyers are willing to buy from you.

If you were to sell 20 shares at market price, the following would be the execution pattern :

- Ten shares sold @ Rs.3294.75
- Six shares sold @ Rs.3294.20
- One share sold @ Rs.3294.15
- Three shares sold @ Rs.3293.85

So, in a nutshell, the bid and offer prices give you information about the top 5 prices at which the buyers and sellers are stacked. You need to understand how buyers and sellers place their trades, especially if you are an intraday trader.

By default, the bid-offer is shown only for the top 5 prices. You can, however, get an insight into the top 20 bids and offers by looking at the 20-depth window. I have discussed 20 in-depth details in the last chpater of this module.




### 9.7 – Conclusion

The trading terminal is your gateway to markets. The trading terminal has many features that are useful to traders. We will explore these features as we progress through the various learning modules. At this stage, you should know how to set up a market watch, transact (buy and sell) in stocks, view the order and trade book, and understand the market depth window.

One last thing before we wind up this chapter – the trading terminal is continuously evolving to ensure the user experience is smooth. A few years down the lane, the UI/UX may have changed, but the concepts of the order book, trade book, SL, limit order, etc, will remain the same.

## 8.Commonly_Used_Jargons

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/commonly-used-jargons/)

This chapter aims to help you familiarize yourself with a few commonly used market terminologies and their concepts.

Let’s get started.

Bull Market (Bullish)  –  If you expect the stock prices to go up, you are bullish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going up during a particular period, it is referred to as a bull market. Example – The market was bullish from mid-2020 to early 2022.

Bear Market (Bearish)  –  If you expect the stock prices to go down, you are bearish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index goes down during a particular period, it is referred to as a bear market. Example – The market was bearish from early 2008 to late 2009.

Trend  –  The term ‘trend’ usually refers to the general market direction and its associated momentum in the market. For example, if the market is declining fast, the trend is said to be bearish. If the market is trading flat with no movement, then the trend is said to be sideways.

Face value of a stock – The face value (FV) or par value indicates the nominal value of a share. The face value is important from a corporate action perspective. We will discuss corporate action in a separate chapter. Usually, when dividends, stock splits, or bonuses are announced, they are issued, keeping the face value in perspective. For example, the FV of Infosys is 5, and if they announce an annual dividend of Rs.63/-, the dividend paid is 1260%s (63 divided by 5).

52-week high/low – 52-week high is the highest price point at which a stock has traded during the last 52 weeks (which also marks a full calendar year); likewise, a 52-week low marks the lowest price point at which the stock has traded during the last 52 weeks. The 52-week high and low gives a sense of the range within which the stock trades during the year. Many traders believe that if a stock price reaches 52 weeks high, it indicates a bullish trend for the foreseeable future. Similarly, if a stock hits 52 week low, some traders believe it indicates a bearish trend for the foreseeable future.

All-time high/low – This is similar to the 52 weeks high and low, with the only difference being that the all-time high price is the highest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed. Similarly, the all-time low price is the lowest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed.

Upper and Lower Circuit – The exchange sets up a price band within which the stock can be traded on a given trading day. The highest price the stock can reach on the day is the upper circuit limit, and the lowest price is the lower circuit limit. The limit for a stock is set to 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20% based on the exchange’s selection criteria. The exchange places these restrictions to control excessive volatility when a stock reacts to certain news related to the company. The criteria (in terms of exchange restriction) changes for derivatives stocks (and index); more on that later.

Long Position – Long position or going long is a reference to the direction of your trade. For example, if you have bought or intend to buy Biocon shares, you are long on Biocon or planning to go long on Biocon, respectively. If you have bought the Nifty Index with an expectation that the index will trade higher, you have a long position on Nifty. You are considered bullish if you are long on a stock or an index.

Short Position – Going short or ‘shorting’ is a term used to describe a transaction carried out in a particular order. This is a slightly tricky concept. To help you understand the concept of shorting, I’d like to narrate an old incident at work; this happened around mid-2014, if I remember right.

If you are a gadget enthusiast like me, you would probably recollect that Xiaomi (a Chinese manufacturer of smartphones) entered into an exclusive partnership with Flipkart to sell their flagship smartphone model called Mi3 in India. The price of Mi3 was speculated to be around Rs.14,000/-. If one wished to buy Mi3, he/she had to be a registered Flipkart user as the phone was not available for a non-registered user, and the registration was open only for a short time. I had promptly registered to buy the phone, but my colleague Rajesh had not. Though he wanted to buy the phone, he could not because he had not registered on time.

Out of sheer desperation, Rajesh walked up to me and made an offer. He said he would buy the phone from me at Rs. 16,500/-. As a trader at heart, I readily agreed to sell him the phone! I even demanded he pays me the money right away.

After I pocketed the money, I thought to myself, what have I done?? Look at the situation I’ve put myself into. I’ve sold a phone to Rajesh, which I don’t own yet!!

But then, it was not a bad deal after all. I agree I had sold a phone that I didn’t own. However, I could always buy the phone on Flipkart and pass the new, unopened box to Rajesh. My only fear in this transaction was, what if the phone price is above Rs.16,500?? In that case, I’d make a loss and regret entering into this transaction with Rajesh. For example, if the phone were priced at Rs.18,000, my loss would be Rs.1,500 (18,000 – 16,500).

However, to my luck, as expected, the phone was priced at Rs.14,000/-, I promptly bought it on Flipkart, and upon delivery, I handed over the phone to Rajesh, and in the whole process, I made a clean profit of Rs.2,500/- (16500 – 14000)!

If you look at the transaction sequence, I first sold the phone (that I didn’t own) to Rajesh, then bought it later on Flipkart and delivered it to Rajesh. I sold it first and bought it later!

This type of transaction is called a ‘Short Trade.’

The concept of shorting is very counter-intuitive to normal humans because we are not used to ‘shorting’ in our day-to-day activity unless we have a trader mentality 🙂

Going back to stock markets, think about this straightforward transaction – on day 1, you buy Wipro shares at Rs.405, two days later (day 3), the stock moves, and you sell your shares at Rs.425. You made a profit of Rs.20/- on this transaction.

In this transaction, your first leg was to buy Wipro at Rs.405, the second leg was to sell Wipro at Rs.425, and you were bullish on the stock.

On day 4, the stock is trading at Rs.425, and you are now bearish. You are convinced that the stock will go back to Rs.405. Is there a way you can profit from your bearish expectation? You could, and it can be done by shorting the stock.

You sell the stock at Rs.425, and 2 days later, assuming the stock trades at Rs.405, you repurchase it.

If you realize the trade’s first leg was to sell at Rs.425, and the second leg was to buy the stock at Rs.405. This is always the case with shorting – you first sell at a price you perceive as high to buy it back at a lower price later.

You have executed the same trade as buying at Rs.405 and selling at Rs.425 but in reverse order.

An obvious question you may have is – How can one sell Wipro shares without owning them? You can do so, just like I sold a phone I did not own. So shorting is possible in the stock markets. The important point to remember is that when you short a stock, you must ensure that you buy back the stock the same day before the market closes. Of course, you can short a stock in the derivatives segment and carry forward the position for a few days. But at this point, ignore the derivatives bit and understand that all short positions in stocks (also called cash segment) have to be closed before the market closes. In other words, a short position in the cash market works only on an intraday basis.

To sum it all up…

1. When you short, you have a bearish view of the stock. You profit if the stock price goes down. After you short, if the stock price goes up, you will end up making a loss. 
 When you short a stock, ensure you buy the stock back the same day before the market closes unless you use derivatives to short. 
 Shorting a stock is easy – you select the stock you wish to short and click on sell.

To summarize long and short positions…


Position | 1st Leg | 2nd Leg | Expectation | Make money when | You will lose money if
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Long | Buy | Sell | Bullish | Stock goes up | Stock price drops
Short | Sell | Buy | Bearish | Stock goes down | Stock price goes up


Alright, let’s continue our discussion on commonly used stock market jargon.

Square off ­– Square off is a term used to indicate that you intend to close an existing position. If you are long on a stock squaring off the position means selling the stock. Note when you close a long position, you have to sell the stock, and this sale is not considered a short position. Here you are merely closing an existing long position!

Squaring off a position means repurchasing the stock when you are short on the stock. Remember, when you repurchase it, you are just closing an existing position, and you are not going long!


When you are | Square off position is
--- | ---
Long | Sell the stock
Short | Buy the stock


Intraday position  –  This is a trading position you initiate with an expectation to square off the position within the same day. For example, all short positions in stocks are intraday positions.

OHLC ­– OHLC in stock prices refers to open, high, low, and close. We will understand more about this in the technical analysis module. For now, open is the price at which the stock opens for the day, high is the highest price at which the stock trade during the day, low is the lowest price at which the stock trades during the day, and close is the closing price of the stock. For example, the OHLC of ACC on 17 th  June was 1486, 1511, 1467, and 1499.

Volume – Volumes and their impact on stock prices are important concepts that we will explore in greater detail in the technical analysis module. Volumes represent the total transactions (buy and sell put together) for a particular stock on a particular day. For example, on 17 th  June, the volume on ACC was 5, 33,819 shares.

Market Segment – A market segment is a division within which a certain type of financial instrument is traded. Each financial instrument is characterized by its risk and reward parameters. The exchange operates in three main segments.

1. Capital Market (CM) – Capital market segments offer tradable securities, such as stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So if you were to buy or sell shares of a company, you are essentially operating in the capital market segment. Shorting stocks, too, comes under the capital market segment. The cash market is sometimes referred to as the spot market. 
 Futures and Options (FO) – Futures and Options, generally referred to as the equity derivative segment, are where leveraged products are traded. We will explore the derivative markets in greater depth in the derivatives module (Futures modules and Options Module) 
 Currency Derivatives (CDS) – The CDS segment is where currency pairs like USD INR, EUR INR, JPY INR are traded. The trading is via futures and options; hence it’s called the currency derivative market. 
 Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) – The wholesale debt market deals with fixed-income securities. Debt instruments include government securities, treasury bills, bonds issued by a public sector undertaking, corporate bonds, corporate debentures, etc.

These are some of the commonly used jargon. If you can think of any other, please comment below, and I’d be happy to decode that for you.



## 15.Supplementary_note_–_The_20_market_depth_or_level_3_data

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/supplementary-note-the-20-market-depth/)



### The 20 Market Depth (level 3 data) Window

I’ve driven a car for many years and I’ve even changed my car a few times now. Each time I changed my car, the engine remained more or less the same, but the features within the vehicle and its aesthetics continuously changed. Air conditioner, power steering, and power windows were all luxury features in the car at one point, but today, I guess no one buys a car without these essential features. The game-changer for me though was parking assist. The little camera at the back of the car gave me complete visibility of the parking space available. I was no longer required to pop and twist my head out and struggle to park the car, nor did I have to bug my co-passenger to get down and help me navigate my way into a parking spot. The parking assist feature did everything and helped me execute a perfect parallel park. The parking assist feature was my edge for hassle-free car parking.

I feel the same edge while trading the markets with the level 3 data 🙂

Level 3 or the 20 market depth feature is unique and has multiple uses. You’ll probably appreciate the level 3 market window if you have traded at an institutional desk. A regular retail trader would not understand this feature anytime soon, simply because this feature was unavailable all these years until we introduced it for the very first time to the Indian retail traders.

The purpose of this chapter is to help you understand how useful this feature is and get you started on building trading strategies around this feature.

If you are entirely new to this, I’d suggest you  read this blog  to understand what the level 3 data is all about.

Assuming you know what it is, this chapter will help you understand the multiple uses of this feature.




### Contract availability

For the option traders, the 20-depth order book gives great visibility into the availability of contracts to trade and help identify better price points to execute these trade. Without this visibility, it becomes really hard to trade illiquid contracts. While I’m specifically talking about options here, you can extend this to Futures contracts as well, especially the illiquid ones.

Let us put this in context, have a look at the regular market depth (i.e. the top 5 bid-ask) of the 13000 CE expiring in Jan 2020.

We can see narrow bids on the left and a notch better offer on the right. You’d probably hesitate to trade this contract if you are someone looking at trading a few lots of Nifty.

But check what’s hiding under the hood here by opening the level 3 data –

As you can see, there are many contracts available, but they are not visible in the regular market depth. In fact, the bid and offer quantities are heavily concentrated below the 8 th  row respectively.

Given the availability of the contracts in this strike, the perspective to trade or not completely changes and will now depend upon your trading strategy.




### Execution control

Level 3 data gives you full visibility of the approximate execution price for your trade. This is particularly useful when you decide to scalp the market. When you scalp the market —

- You trade large quantities, i.e. buy and sell large amounts in quick succession to profit from small tick moves in the stock
- Since these are quick trades, you place market orders only

Let us say you want to buy and sell 5000 shares of Hindustan Zinc; the regular market depth window gives you the following information —

As you can see, there is no visibility on how these 5000 shares will get filled. Now, take a look at the 20 depth window —

The 20 depth window paints an entirely different picture. It not only tells me that I’ll get the 5000 shares, but it also gives me information about the approximate buy price. If I were to place a market order for 5000 shares, I’d be buying this order book from 210.5 to 211.25. I also see at 211; there are 2425 shares available, so I can expect the average price is at or around 211.

Now, my decision to scalp the stock should depend on the pop I’d expect over and above 211. Maybe 211.5 or so. Of course, you’ll get the exact breakeven (post charges) if you were to use a brokerage calculator.




### Position sizing

Level 3 market window plays a critical role in ‘guesstimating’ the number of shares to trade, given the liquidity of the stock. For the sake of this discussion, we will assume that the availability of capital is not an issue.

Now, have a look at the regular market depth —

You expect Siemens to move from 1675 to about 1690 over the next hour. So, given the fact that you are not constrained by capital, how many shares will you buy for this intraday trade?

The regular market depth window suggests that you can buy close to 175 shares. However, the 20 depth opens up a different perspective altogether —

In fact, the liquidity in this stock lies below the best five bid and ask, and the impact cost is reasonable. The regular market depth window fails to capture this information. Assuming you intend to buy about 1500 shares, the buy price will lie somewhere within 1675.5 to 1678, which is spread of 0.149%.

In this case, assuming you are sure about the target price (1690), you can go all in and buy through whatever is available at that moment.




### Order placement

You can extend the position sizing concept and use the 20 depth market watch to place a stop loss or a limit order. Assume you have an intraday buy position in VST Tillers at 1313.8.

The question is, where you would place the stop loss for this trade? Can the 20 market depth help us with this?

Of course. Have a look at the 20 depth window for VST Tillers. As you can see, there is a concentration of bids in 1290. The good part is that the number of order count is also the highest (35) in 1290.

This implies that several traders have placed an order at 1290, indicating some sort of price action at that level. This perhaps builds a case for placing the stop-loss.

A prudent trader would probably place a stoploss not at 1290, but maybe at a price just below it.

So I was a buyer in this stock, then purely based on 20 depth I’d probably place my SL at 1290 or below, maybe at 1287 and by the same logic, set my target at 1340 or at 1338.8.




### Validate the support and resistance level

I find this extremely interesting. In the example above, we identified 1290 as the stoploss price, simply because there was a concentration of bids. In other words, we expect 1290 as a support price.

If this is indeed true, then it should show up on the charts as well, right? Have a look at the chart below –

Clearly, there is some price action around 1296. Remember, support and resistance is not one price point, but rather a range. Therefore 1290 – 1300 marks as an intraday support for this stock.

This is a perfect example of seeing the price action concept play out in the market.

Another way to look at this is first to identify the S&R level and then check the 20 depth to figure if there is a concentration of bids/offers in that zone.

Hopefully, by now you’ve started to appreciate the immeasurable value 20 depth order book brings to you while trading.

Remember, irrespective of which technique you use to develop a point of view (technical or quantitative analysis), things boil down to price, and the action trades take at that price.

The 20 depth market window is essentially your ticket to validate the truth of this price action. Make sure you use your card wisely!

Do post your comments and tell us how differently you will use the 20 depth window for identifying trading opportunities.

Good luck!



## 3.Market_Intermediaries

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/financial-intermediaries/)



### 3.1 – Overview

Many corporate entities work in tandem to ensure transactions in the market flow smoothly. Right from the time you log in to a trading terminal (let’s say to buy shares), to the time these shares hit your DEMAT account, market intermediaries work seamlessly together to ensure your transactions flow without any hiccups.

These entities play their role quietly behind the scene, always complying with the rules laid out by SEBI and ensuring an effortless and smooth experience for your transactions in the stock market. These entities are generally referred to as Financial Intermediaries or market intermediaries.

Together, these financial intermediaries, interdependent on one another, create an ecosystem in which the financial markets operate. Let us quickly review a few of these key market intermediaries and the roles they play in the ecosystem.




### 3.2 – The Stock Broker

The stockbroker is probably one of the most important financial intermediaries you need to know. A stockbroker is a corporate entity registered as a trading member with the stock exchange and holds a stockbroking license. SEBI grants the license through due diligence, and the broker is expected to comply with the rules prescribed by SEBI.

A stockbroker is your gateway to the stock markets to make investments in stocks, bonds, ETFs, and Mutual funds. To transact in the stock market, you must set up (open account) with a stockbroker of your choice. Many stock brokers are registered in India, and you can choose a broker based on personal criteria. A few popular filters based on which people select stockbrokers are –

- The simplicity of the broker platform 
 The efficiency of the broker’s support system 
 Access to ready reports – Profit & Loss reports, Tradebook, Tax P&L 
 Broker’s net worth (you dont want to deal with a broker who is not profitable or does not have a good P&L) 
 Initiatives like education

- Access to ready reports – Profit & Loss reports, Tradebook, Tax P&L
- Broker’s net worth (you dont want to deal with a broker who is not profitable or does not have a good P&L)
- Initiatives like education

Once you decide on your broker and open a trading and DEMAT account, you can start transacting in the stock market. After setting up your account, there are a few standard ways to interact with your broker.

1. You can call your broker, identify yourself with your client code (account code) and place an order for your transaction. The dealer at the other end will execute the order for you and confirm the status of the same while you are still on the call. 
 Do it yourself – this is perhaps the most popular way to transact in the markets. The broker gives you access to the market via a ‘Trading Terminal’. After you log in to the trading terminal, you can view live price quotes from the market and place orders yourself. For example, Zerodha’s trading platform is called ‘Kite’. 
 Advanced users can access the market programmatically via APIs. Some of the brokers provide APIs for a fee.

The essential services provided by the broker include…

1. Access to the markets and allow you to transact 
 Margins for trading, we will discuss this point at a later point 
 Support in terms of call and trade, help you resolve queries, educate you on markets 
 Issue contract notes for the transactions – A contract note is a written confirmation detailing the transactions you have carried out during the day. 
 Facilitate the fund transfer between your trading and bank account 
 Provide you with a back-office. The back office is a portal to access many reports about your account. Zerodha’s back office is called Console. 
 The broker charges a fee for the services provided, also called the ‘brokerage charge’ or just brokerage. The brokerage rates vary, and it’s up to you to find a broker you think strikes a balance between the brokerage charged and the services provided.

### 3.3 – Depository and Depository Participants

When you buy a property, the only way to identify and claim that you own the property is by producing the property papers. Hence, it becomes essential to keep the property papers safe and secure.

Likewise, when you buy a share (a share represents part ownership in a company), the only way to claim ownership is by producing your share certificate. A share certificate is nothing but a document entitling you as the owner of the shares in a company. Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format; however, post-1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. Converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called “Dematerialization,” often abbreviated as DEMAT.

Did you know the Harshad Mehta scam of 1992, played a significant role in digitizing the share certificate? I’d suggest you watch the SonyLiv series on the Harshad Mehta saga, it gives you a good perspective of the market’s ecosystem before it went digital.

The share certificate in DEMAT format has to be stored digitally. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the ‘DEMAT Account. A Depository is a financial intermediary that offers the Demat account service.  Think of the demat account as a digital vault for your shares. As you may have guessed, your broker’s trading account and the DEMAT account from the Depository are interlinked.

For example, if your idea is to buy Infosys shares, then all you need to do is open your trading account, look for Infosys’ prices, and buy it. Once the transaction is complete, the role of your trading account is done. After you buy, the shares of Infosys will automatically get credited to your demat account.

Likewise, when you wish to sell Infosys shares, you must log in to your trading account and sell the stock. The act of selling is carried out in your trading account. But in the backend, because your trading account and demat account are linked, the broker debits your demat account of the shares you have sold.

At present, only two depositaries offer DEMAT account services. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two, and both operate under strict SEBI regulations.

You cannot walk into National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) office to open a trading account, likewise, you cannot walk into a Depository (NSDL or CDSL) to open a demat account. To open a demat account, you must speak to a Depository Participant (DP). A DP helps you set up your DEMAT account with a Depository. A DP acts as an intermediary between you and the Depository. Even the DP is governed by the regulations laid out by the SEBI.

Zerodha is a depositary participant of Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL).




### 3.4 – Banks

Banks play a straightforward role in the market ecosystem. They help facilitate the fund transfer from your bank account to your trading account. Both the trading account and bank account are linked. Broker’s link these accounts after verifying your bank account.

You can link multiple bank accounts to your trading through which you can transfer funds and trade. Irrespective of how many bank accounts you choose to link with your trading account, funds can be withdrawn to only one bank account. The account you choose to withdraw funds (from your trading account) is called the ‘Primary account.’ At Zerodha, you can add one primary bank account and up to 2 secondary bank accounts. You can add funds to all the bank accounts, but withdrawals are only processed to the primary bank account.

Also, dividend payments and money from buybacks will be sent to the primary bank account. The primary bank account is connected to your trading account, the Depository, the Registrar, and the transfer agents (RTA).

At this stage, you must have realized that the three financial intermediaries operate via three different accounts – a trading account offered by your broker, demat account offered by the depositary participant, and a Bank account offered by a bank. All three accounts operate electronically and are interlinked, giving you a seamless experience.




### 3.5 – NSE clearing Limited and ICCL

NSE Clearing Limited and Indian Clearing Corporation (ICCL) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange, respectively.

The job of the clearing corporation is to ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions. For example, if you buy one Biocon share at Rs.446 per share, someone must sell that one share to you at Rs.446. For this transaction, you will be debited Rs.446 from your trading account, and the seller must be credited that Rs.446 toward the sale of Biocon. In a typical transaction like this, the clearing corporation’s role is to ensure the following:

- Identify the buyer and seller and match the debit and credit process 
 Ensure no defaults – The clearing corporation also ensures no defaults by either party. For instance, after selling the shares, the seller should not be able to back out, thereby defaulting in his transaction.
- Identify the buyer and seller and match the debit and credit process
- Ensure no defaults – The clearing corporation also ensures no defaults by either party. For instance, after selling the shares, the seller should not be able to back out, thereby defaulting in his transaction.

For all practical purposes, it’s ok not to know much about NSE Clearing Limited or ICCL simply because you, as a trader or investor, would not be interacting with these agencies directly. You need to know these institutions are also heavily regulated and work towards a smooth settlement and efficient clearing activity.

Clearing corporations are also involved in the margining process, which is critical while trading complex instruments like futures and options. Perhaps, we will discuss this aspect in a related discussion.

1. The market ecosystem is built by a cluster of financial intermediaries, each offering services unique to the functioning of markets.
1. A stockbroker is your market access, so choose a broker that matches your requirements.
1. A stockbroker provides you with a trading account that is used for all market-related transactions (buying and selling of financial instruments like shares)
1. A Depository is a corporate entity that holds the shares electronically in your name in your account. Your account with the depository is called the ‘DEMAT’ account.
1. There are only two depositories in India – NSDL and CDSL.
1. To open a DEMAT account with one of the depositaries, you must liaise with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP functions as an agent to the Depository
1. A clearing corporation works towards clearing and settling trades executed by you.



## 1.The_Need_to_Invest

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-need-to-invest/)



### 1.1 – Why should I invest?

Before we address the above question, let us understand what would happen if one chooses not to invest. Assume you earn Rs.50,000/- per month, and you spend Rs.30,000/-towards your day-to-day living; this can include expenses like housing, food, transport, shopping, medical, etc. The balance of Rs.20,000/- is your monthly surplus.

For the sake of simplicity, let us ignore the tax effect in this discussion.

To drive the point across, let us make a few simple assumptions –

1. The employer is kind enough to give you a 10% salary hike every year. 
 The cost of living is likely to go up by 8% yearly. 
 You are 30 years old and plan to retire at 50, this translates to 20 working years. 
 You don’t intend to work after you retire. 
 Your expenses are fixed, and you don’t foresee any other expenses. 
  The balance cash of Rs.20,000/- per month is retained as hard cash.

20 | 36,69,545 | 15,53,652 | 21,15,893
Total Income | 17,890,693


If one were to analyze these numbers, one would soon realize this is a scary situation. A few things are quite obvious –

1. After 20 years of hard work, you have accumulated Rs.1.7Crs. 
 Since your expenses are fixed, your lifestyle has not changed over the years, and you probably even suppressed your lifelong aspirations – a better home, car, vacations, etc. 
 After you retire, assuming the expenses will continue to grow at 8%, the retirement corpus of Rs.1.7Crs is good enough to sail you through roughly 8 years of post-retirement life. 8th year onwards, you will be in a tight spot with literally no savings left to back you up.

What would you do after you run out of money in 8 years? How do you fund your life? Is there a way to ensure that you collect a more considerable sum at the end of 20 years?

At this point, you may think that the assumptions are simple and that real life does not work like this. I agree, and I won’t dispute that fact. However, the point to note in the above calculation is that no investments are made, hence the cash retained has a flat or zero growth.

Let’s consider another scenario where instead of keeping the cash idle, you choose to invest the cash in an investment option that grows at, let’s say, 12% per annum. For example – in the first year, you retained Rs.240,000/- which, when invested at 12% per annum for 20 years (19 years assuming you invest at the end of 1st year), yields Rs.2,067,063/- at the end of the 20th year. For those interested in math, here is how that works –

= 240000*(1+12%)^(19)

=  2067063

Dont worry about the math at this point. We will explain that later in this module (and several other modules in Varsity). Here is how the table looks if you choose to invest.


Years | Yearly Income | Yearly Expense | Cash Retained | Retained Cash Invested @12%
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 600,000 | 360,000 | 240,000 | 20,67,063

Total cash after 20 years | 


Your cash balance has increased significantly with the decision to invest surplus cash. The cash balance has grown to Rs.4.26Crs from Rs.1.7Crs,  a staggering 2.4x more than earlier (when you choose not to invest). Clearly, with the decision to invest, you are in a much better situation to deal with your post-retirement life.

Now, going back to the initial question of why invest? There are a few compelling reasons –

1. Fight Inflation  – By investing, one can deal better with the inevitable reality of life – the growing cost of living – generally referred to as Inflation. 
 Create Wealth  – By investing, one can build a bigger corpus by the end of the target period. In the above example, the period was up to retirement, but it can be anything – children’s education, marriage, house purchase, retirement holidays, etc 
 Better life  – To meet life’s financial aspirations.

### 1.2 – Where to invest?

Having figured out the reasons to invest, the next obvious question is – where would one invest, and what return can one expect with investing? When investing, one has to choose an  asset class  that suits the individual’s risk and returns profile. For example, one individual will be open to taking a lot of risk with his or her money, while another may want to take moderate risk, while another would want zero risk.

Think of an asset class as an investment vehicle defined by its risk and return characteristics.  The following are some of the popular asset classes.

1. Fixed income instruments 
 Equity 
 Real estate 
 Commodities (precious metals)
1. Fixed income instruments
1. Equity
1. Real estate
1. Commodities (precious metals)

Fixed-income instruments are investment avenues where your principal amount (the money you invest) is perceived to be safe. The entity pays an interest amount on the principal you invest. The bank’s fixed deposit scheme is the simplest example of a fixed investment instrument.  The interest paid could be quarterly, semi-annual or annual. The capital is returned to the investor at the end of the investment period, also known as the maturity period.

A few examples for fixed-income instruments are –

1. Bank’s Fixed deposits
1. Bonds issued by the Government of India (also called G Sec bonds and T Bills)
1. Bonds issued by Government related agencies such as GAIL, HUDCO, NHAI, etc
1. Bonds issued by corporate’s (Tata, Bajaj, Reliance, Adani)

As of October 2022, the typical return from a fixed-income instrument (bank’s FD) varies between 5 – 6%. Government bonds offer about 5.5%, and a few corporate bonds offer nearly 9 or 10%. The rates across different instruments vary because of the risk varies. The Govt bonds are considered the safest investment, with zero risk to your investment, because, well, the govt can’t cheat and run away with your money. Corporate bonds are risky, though; investment in corporate bonds can go to zero, and we have seen plenty of such examples in the past.

Investment in Equities involves buying shares of publicly listed companies. The shares are traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

When an investor invests in equity, unlike a fixed-income instrument, there is no capital guarantee. However, as a trade-off, the returns from equity investment can be much better. Indian Equities have generated upwards of 12% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over the past 10 to 15 years.

Investing in some of the best and most well-run Indian companies has yielded over 20% CAGR in the long term. Identifying such investment opportunities requires skill, hard work, and patience.

Real Estate Investment involves transacting (buying and selling) commercial and non-commercial land. Typical examples include transacting in vacant plots, apartments, and commercial buildings. There are two income sources from real estate investments: Rental income and Capital appreciation of the investment amount. The rental yield typically varies between 2-3%, which is not so attractive, in my opinion. The appreciation in land prices is in select pockets and is not uniform.

The transaction procedure can be quite complex involving legal verification of documents. The cash outlay in real estate investment is usually quite large. There is no official metric to measure the returns generated by real estate. Hence it would be hard to comment on this.

Gold and silver are considered one of the most popular investment options.  Gold and silver, over the long term, have appreciated. Investments in these metals have yielded a CAGR return of approximately 5-8% over the last 20 years. There are several ways to invest in gold and silver. One can invest in jewelry, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), or  Sovereign Gold bonds , popularly called as SGBs.

Going back to our initial example of investing the surplus cash, it would be interesting to see how much one would have saved by the end of 20 years, considering he can invest in any one – fixed income, equity, or bullion.

1. By investing in fixed income at an average rate of 9% per annum (good corporate bond), the corpus would have grown to Rs.3.3Crs.
1. Investing in equities at an average rate of 15% per annum, the corpus would have grown to Rs.5.4Crs.
1. Investing in bullion at an average rate of 8% per annum, the corpus would have grown to Rs.3.09Crs.

Equities tend to give you the best returns, especially when you have a multi-year investment perspective.

Many of you reading this may wonder why I’ve not considered Cryptocurrencies as an asset class. When you invest your hard-earned money, you need to ensure enough checks, balances, and regulatory frameworks to protect you as an investor. Crypto, lacks all these; hence I’d suggest you stay away from crypto (or any other fancy investment option) till there is a regulatory framework.

It is best if your investments have a mix of all asset classes. It is wise to diversify your investment among the various asset classes. The technique of allocating money across asset classes is termed ‘Asset Allocation’, and we will discuss asset allocation later in Varsity.

For instance, a young professional may take a higher risk given the age and years of investment available. Typically investors should allocate at least 60% of their investable amount in equity, 20% in precious metals, and 20% in fixed-income investments. The percentage mix changes based on risk profile and age. For example, a retired person could invest 80% in fixed income (Govt bonds maybe), 10% in equity markets, and 10% in precious metals.




### 1.3 – Things to note before investing

Investing is an integral part of financial planning, but before you start your investment journey, it is good to be aware of the following –

1. Risk and Return go hand in hand. Higher the risk, the higher the return. The lower the risk, the lower the return. 
 Investment in fixed income is a good option if you want to protect your principal amount. It is relatively less risky. However, you have the risk of losing money when you adjust the inflation return. Example – A fixed deposit that gives you 9% when the inflation is 10% means you lose a net of 1% per annum. Alternatively, the risk increases if you invest in a corporate fixed-income instrument. 
 Investment in Equities is a great option. It is known to beat inflation over a long period. Historically equity investment has generated returns close to 14-15%. However, equity investments can be risky. 
 Real Estate investment requires a significant outlay of cash and cannot be done with smaller amounts. Liquidity is another issue with real estate investment – you cannot buy or sell whenever you want. 
 Gold and silver are relatively safer, but the historical return on such investment has not been very encouraging.

1. A good investment practice is to build a portfolio that mixes all asset classes.



## 6.The_Stock_Markets

### 6.1 – Public Limited company

Having understood the IPO process and the circumstances that lead a company to offer its shares to the public and raise funds,  we are now set to explore the stock markets a step further.

Once a company becomes publicly traded, the company is obligated to disclose all information related to the company to the public. The shares of a public limited company are traded on the stock exchanges daily. There are a few reasons why market participants trade stocks. We will explore some of these reasons in this chapter.




### 6.2 – What is the stock market?

As we discussed earlier, the stock market is an electronic marketplace. Buyers and sellers electronically express their points of view in terms of trade.

For example, consider the current situation of Infosys. When writing this, Infosys faces a management succession issue, and most of the company’s senior-level executives are resigning. The leadership vacuum is weighing down the company’s reputation heavily. As a result, the stock price dropped to Rs.3,000 from Rs.3,500.

Assume there are two traders – A and B.

A’s view on Infosys – The stock price will likely go down further because the company will find it challenging to find a new CEO. If A trades from his point of view, he should be a seller of the Infosys stock.

However, B views the same situation differently and has a different point of view. According to her, the stock price of Infosys has overreacted to the succession issue, and soon the company will find a great leader. The stock price will eventually move up.

If B trades from her point of view, she should be a buyer of the Infosys stock.

So at, Rs.3000, A will be a seller, and B will be a buyer in Infosys.

Now both A and B will place orders to sell and buy the stocks respectively through their respective stock brokers. The stock broker routes it to the stock exchange. The stock exchange has to ensure that these two orders are matched and that the trade is executed. This is the primary job of the stock market – to facilitate the transactions between different market participants.

A stock market is where market participants can access any publicly listed company and trade from their point of view as long as other participants have an opposing point of view. After all, different opinions are what make a market.




### 6.3 – What moves the stock?

Let us continue with the Infosys example to understand how stocks move. Imagine you are a market participant tracking Infosys.

It is 10:00 AM Infosys is trading at Rs.3000 per share. The management makes a press statement that they have found a new CEO expected to steer the company to greater heights. They are confident that the newly appointed CEO will do good things for the company.

Two questions –

1. How will the stock price of Infosys react to this news? 
 If you were to place a trade on Infosys, what would it be? Would it be a buy or a sell?
1. How will the stock price of Infosys react to this news?
1. If you were to place a trade on Infosys, what would it be? Would it be a buy or a sell?

The answer to the first question is quite simple; the news is positive, so the stock price will increase. Infosys had a leadership issue, and the company has fixed it. When positive announcements are made, market participants tend to buy the stock at any given price, which cascades into a stock price rally.

Let me illustrate this further :


Sl No | Time | Last Traded Price | What price the seller wants | What does the buyer do? | New Last Trade Price
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
01 | 10:00 | 3000 | 3002 | Buys | 3002
02 | 10:01 | 3002 | 3006 | Buys | 3006
03 | 10:03 | 3006 | 3011 | Buys | 3011
04 | 10:05 | 3011 | 3016 | Buys | 3016


Notice that the buyer is willing to pay whatever prices the seller wants; this is when the market is said to be bullish. In a bullish market, the prices tend to move up.

So as you can see, the stock price jumped 16 Rupees in a matter of 5 minutes. Though this is a fictional situation, it is a realistic and typical behavior of stocks. The stock price increases when the news is good or expected to be good.

In this particular case, the stock moves up because of two reasons. One, the leadership issue has been fixed, and two, there is also an expectation that the new CEO will steer the company to greater heights.

The answer to the second question is now quite simple; you buy Infosys stocks because there is good news surrounding the stock.

Now, moving forward on the same day, at 12:30 PM, ‘The National Association of Software & Services company’ (NASSCOM) makes a statement stating that the customer’s IT budget seems to have come down by 15%, which could have an impact on the industry in the future. For those unaware, NASSCOM is a trade association of Indian IT companies.

By 12:30 PM, let us assume Infosys is trading at 3030. Few questions for you…

1. How does this new information impact Infosys? 
 What would it be if you were to initiate a new trade with this information? 
 What would happen to the other IT stocks in the market?
1. How does this new information impact Infosys?
1. What would it be if you were to initiate a new trade with this information?
1. What would happen to the other IT stocks in the market?

The answers to the above questions are quite simple. Before we answer these questions, let us analyze NASSCOM’s statement in more detail.

NASSCOM says that the IT budget is likely to shrink by 15%. This means IT companies’ revenues and profits will likely go down soon. This is not great news for the IT industry.

Let us now try and answer the above questions…

1. Infosys is a leading IT major in the country and will react to this news. The reaction could be mixed because there was good news specific to Infosys earlier during the day. However, a 15% decline in revenue is a serious matter, and hence Infosys stocks are likely to trade lower. 
 At 3030, if one were to initiate a new trade based on the new information, it would be a sell on Infosys. 
 The information released by NASSCOM applies to the entire IT stocks and not just Infosys. Hence all IT companies are likely to witness selling pressure.

1. The information released by NASSCOM applies to the entire IT stocks and not just Infosys. Hence all IT companies are likely to witness selling pressure.

So as you notice, market participants react to news and events, and their reaction translates to price movements! This is what makes the stocks move.

At this stage, you may wonder what would happen to a company’s share price if there is no news. Will the stock price stay flat and not move at all? The answer is yes and no, depending on the company in focus.

For example, let us assume there is no news concerning two different companies…

1. Reliance Industries Limited 
 Shree Lakshmi Sugar Mills
1. Reliance Industries Limited
1. Shree Lakshmi Sugar Mills

As we all know, Reliance is one the largest companies in the country, and regardless of whether there is news or not, market participants would like to buy or sell the company’s shares, and therefore the price moves constantly.

The second company is relatively unknown and, therefore, may not attract market participants’ attention as there is no news or event surrounding this company. Under such circumstances, the stock price may not move, or even if it does, it may be very marginal.

To summarize, the price moves because of expectations of news and events. The news or events can be directly related to the company, industry, or the economy as a whole. For instance, the appointment of Narendra Modi as the Indian Prime Minister was perceived as positive news, and therefore the whole stock market moved.

In some cases, there would be no news, but still, the price could move due to the demand and supply situation.




### 6.4 – How does the stock get traded?

You have decided to buy 200 shares of Infosys at 3030 and hold on to it for one year. How does it work? What is the exact process of buying the stock? What happens after you buy it?

Systems work seamlessly to ensure your transactions go smoothly.

With your decision to buy Infosys, you need to log in to your trading account (provided by your stock broker) and place an order to buy Infosys. Once you place an order, the following details are validated –

1. Details of your trading account through which you intend to buy Infosys shares. 
 The price at which you intend to buy Infosys 
 The number of shares you intend to buy
1. Details of your trading account through which you intend to buy Infosys shares.
1. The price at which you intend to buy Infosys
1. The number of shares you intend to buy

Before your broker transmits this order to the exchange, the broker has to ensure you have sufficient money to buy these shares. If yes, then this order hits the stock exchange. Once the order hits the market, the stock exchange (through their order matching algorithm) tries to find a seller who is willing to sell you 200 shares of Infosys at 3030.

Now the seller could be one person willing to sell the entire 200 shares at 3030, or it could be ten people selling 20 shares each, or two people selling 1 and 199 shares, respectively. The permutation and combination do not matter. From your perspective, all you need is 200 shares of Infosys at 3030, and you have placed an order for the same. The stock exchange ensures the shares are available to you as long as sellers are in the market.

Once the trade is executed, the shares will be electronically credited to your DEMAT account. Likewise, the shares will be electronically debited from the seller’s DEMAT account.




### 6.5 – What happens after you own stock?

After you buy the shares, the shares will reside in your DEMAT account. You are now a part owner of the company to the extent of your shareholding. To give you a perspective, if you own 200 shares of Infosys, you own 0.000035% of Infosys at the time of writing this chapter.

By owning the shares, you are entitled to corporate benefits like dividends, stock splits, bonuses, rights issues, voting rights, etc. We will explore all these shareholder privileges at a later stage.




### 6.6 – A note on the holding period

The holding period is the period you intend to hold the stock. You may be surprised that the holding period could be as short as a few minutes to as long as ‘forever.’ When the legendary investor Warren Buffet was asked what his favorite holding period was, he replied ‘forever.’

In the earlier example quoted in this chapter, we illustrated how Infosys stocks moved from 3000 to 3016 in 5 minutes. Well, this is not a bad return after all, for a 5 Minute holding period! If you are satisfied with it, you can close the trade and move on to find another opportunity. To remind you, this is very much possible in real markets. When things are hot, such moves are quite common.




### 6.7 – How to calculate returns?

Now, everything in markets boils down to one thing. Generating a reasonable rate of return! All past stock market sins are forgiven if your trade generates a good return. Returns are usually expressed in terms of annual yield. There are different kinds of returns that you need to be aware of. The following will give you a sense of what they are and how to calculate these returns.

Absolute Return  – This is the return that your trade or investment generates in absolute terms. It helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550. How much percentage return did I generate?

The formula to calculate is – [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value – 1]*100

i.e. [3550/3030 -1] *100

= 0.1716 * 100

= 17.16%

A 17.6% is not a bad return at all!

Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)  –  An absolute return can be misleading if you want to compare two investments. CAGR helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030, held the stock for two years, and sold it at 3550. At what rate did my investment grow over the last two years?

CAGR factors in the time component, which we had ignored when we computed the absolute return.

The formula to calculate CAGR is…

Applying this to answer the question…

{[3550/3030]^(1/2) – 1} = 8.2%

This means the investment grew at a rate of 8.2% for two years. As of today, the bank fixed deposit market offers 5.5% with capital protection hence, 8.2% return looks ok compared to a fixed deposit.

So, always use CAGR to check returns over multiple years. Use absolute return when your time frame is for a year or lesser.

What if you bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550 within six months? In that case, you have generated 17.16% in 6 months, which translates to 34.32% (17.16% * 2) for the year.

So the point is if you have to compare returns, it’s best done when the return is expressed on an annualized basis.




### 6.8 – Where do you fit in?

Each market participant has a unique style of participating in the market. The style evolves as you progress as a participant and witness market cycles. The participation style is also defined by the risk you are willing to take in the market. Regardless of what you do, you can be categorized as a trader or investor.

A trader is a person who spots an opportunity and initiates the trade with an expectation of profitably exiting the trade at the earliest given opportunity. A trader usually has a short-term view of markets.  Trader is alert and on their toes during market hours, constantly evaluating opportunities based on risk and reward. A trader is unbiased toward going long or going short. We will discuss what going long or short means at a later stage.

There are different types of traders :

1. Day Trader  – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward trading positions overnight. A day trader is risk-averse and does not like taking an overnight risk. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15 AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM, making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day, sometimes even more. 
 Scalper  – A type of day trader. A scalper usually trades very large shares and holds the stock for less time to make a small but quick profit. For example – a scalper buys 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sells it 2212.1 at 9.16, ending up making 1000/- profit in this trade. On any given day, the scalper trades multiple times during the day. As you may have noticed, a scalp trader is highly risk-averse. 
 Swing Trader  – A swing trader holds on to the trade for a slightly longer; the duration can run anywhere between a few days to weeks. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12 th  June and sell it at 2214 on 19 th  June.
1. Day Trader  – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward trading positions overnight. A day trader is risk-averse and does not like taking an overnight risk. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15 AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM, making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day, sometimes even more.
1. Scalper  – A type of day trader. A scalper usually trades very large shares and holds the stock for less time to make a small but quick profit. For example – a scalper buys 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sells it 2212.1 at 9.16, ending up making 1000/- profit in this trade. On any given day, the scalper trades multiple times during the day. As you may have noticed, a scalp trader is highly risk-averse.
1. Swing Trader  – A swing trader holds on to the trade for a slightly longer; the duration can run anywhere between a few days to weeks. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12 th  June and sell it at 2214 on 19 th  June.

Some of the successful traders are – George Soros, Ed Seykota, Paul Tudor, Micheal Steinhardt, Van K Tharp, Stanley Druckenmiller, and the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala etc

An investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. The investor is willing to wait for the investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors.

1. Growth Investors  – The objective here is to identify companies expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, and Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape, creating massive wealth for their shareholders. 
 Value Investors  – The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in the growth or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short-term market sentiment, thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is stock tanking in the Covid crash of March 2020. Due to short-term negative sentiment, almost all the good stocks were beaten down significantly around March/April 2020, only to post a V-shaped recovery in the subsequent months.

So what kind of market participant would you like to be?

1. A stock market is where a trader or an investor can transact (buy, sell) in shares. 
 A stock market is a place where the buyer and seller meet electronically 
 Different opinions make a market 
 The stock exchange electronically facilitates the transaction of buyers and sellers. 
 News and events move the stock prices daily. 
 Demand-supply mismatch also makes the stock prices move 
 When you own a stock, you get corporate privileges like bonuses, dividends, rights, etc 
 The holding period is defined as the period during which you hold your shares 
 Use absolute returns when the holding period is one year or less. Use CAGR to identify the growth rate over multiple years

### 5.1 – Overview

This chapter was updated on 15th November 2022. A few comments in the query section may seem out of place. Kindly ignore those comments. The essence of the chapter remains the same.

The previous chapter gave us perspective on how a company evolves from the idea generation stage until it decides to file for an IPO. The idea behind creating the fictional story in the previous chapter was to give you a sense of how a business matures over time. Of course, many nuances were intentionally overlooked to drive the point across, and I hope that helped. The emphasis was on the different stages of business and funding options available at various stages of business.

Circumstances leading to an IPO are extremely important to understand because the IPO market, also called the  Primary market , sometimes attracts many new first-time stock market investors. In this chapter, we will understand the IPO process and the many different aspects of a company’s IPO.




### 5.2 – Why do companies go public?

We closed the previous chapter with a few unanswered questions: Why did the company decide to file for an IPO, and in general, why do companies go public?

When a company decides to file for an IPO, one of the main reasons is to raise funds to fuel its CAPEX requirement. Apart from this, there are several other reasons for an IPO, sometimes, a company raises funds via IPO to reduce a high-cost debt, or sometimes a company can IPO to give an exit for an early-stage investor. Here is something interesting you can do. Think about a company that went IPO recently, and google for the IPO reason, and you’ll know why the company went public.

The promoter has three advantages in taking his company public –

1. Raise  funds to meet CAPEX requirement 
 Avoid the need to raise debt which means there are no finance charges to pay, which further translates to better profitability. 
 The promoter can spread the risk amongst a large group of investors instead of one large investor. 100s and thousands of retail investors are better than one large private equity investor.

There are other advantages as well in filing for an IPO –

1. Provide an exit for early investors  – Once the company goes public, the shares of the company start trading publicly. Any existing company shareholders– promoters, angel investors, venture capitalists, or PE funds; can use this opportunity to sell their shares in the open market. By selling their shares, they get an exit on their initial investment in the company. Of course, there is a lock-in period before which early investors cant exit, but that is beside the point. 
 Reward employees  –Employees, working for the company would have shares allotted to them as an incentive. This arrangement between the employee and the company is called the “Employee Stock Option” or ESOPS. The shares are allotted at a discount to the employees. Once the company goes public, the employees can see capital appreciation in the shares. A few examples where the employee benefited from ESOP would be Google, Infosys, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, etc 
 Improve visibility  – Going public increases visibility as the company is publicly held and traded. There is a greater chance of people’s interest in the company, consequently impacting its growth.

### 5.3 – Merchant Bankers

Having decided to go public, the company must do a series of things to ensure a successful initial public offering. The first and foremost step would be to appoint a  merchant banker.  Merchant bankers are called  Book Running Lead Managers (BRLM)/Lead Managers (LM).  The job of a merchant banker is to assist the company with various aspects of the IPO process, including:

- Conduct due diligence on the company filing for an IPO, ensure their legal compliance and issue a due diligence certificate. 
 Work closely with the company and prepare their listing documents, including  Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP).  We will discuss this in a bit more detail at a later stage. 
 Underwriting shares  – In underwriting shares, merchant bankers agree to take up the unsubscribed portion of an IPO. The underwriting is taken up for fresh shares issued during the IPO. The merchant banker takes up the remaining shares if the subscription is above a defined threshold but is not subscribed fully. If the subscription is below the threshold, the IPO is deemed to have failed. All investor money is unblocked in the investors’ accounts. In March 2020, Anthony Waste Limited IPO’s subscription was below the threshold. 
 Help the company arrive at the price band for the IPO. A  price band  is the lower and upper limit of the share price within which the company will sell its shares to IPO applicants. For example, the current IPO of Keystone Realtors Limited has a price band of Rs.514 to Rs.541. 
 Help the company with the roadshows. The roadshow is like a promotional/marketing activity for the company’s IPO 
 Appointment of other intermediaries, namely, registrars, bankers, advertising agencies, etc. The Lead manager also makes various marketing strategies for the issue.

- Appointment of other intermediaries, namely, registrars, bankers, advertising agencies, etc. The Lead manager also makes various marketing strategies for the issue.

Once the company partners with the merchant banker, they will work towards taking the company public.




### 5.4 – IPO sequence of events

Every step in the IPO sequence must happen under the SEBI guidelines. In general, the following is the sequence of steps involved.

- Appoint a merchant banker . In case of a large public issue, the company can appoint more than one merchant banker 
 Apply to SEBI with a registration statement  – The registration statement contains details on what the company does, why the company plans to go public, and the financial health of the company 
 Getting a nod from SEBI  – Once SEBI receives the registration statement, SEBI takes a call on whether to issue a go-ahead or a ‘no go’ to the IPO 
 DRHP  – If the company gets the initial SEBI nod, then the company needs to prepare the DRHP. A DRHP is a document that gets circulated to the public. Along with a lot of information, DRHP should contain the following details:
 
 The estimated size of the IPO 
 The estimated number of shares being offered to the public 
 Why the company wants to go public, and how does the company plan to utilize the funds along with the timeline projection of fund utilization 
 Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details 
 Complete financial statements 
 Management Discussion and Analysis – how the company perceives future business operations to emerge 
 Risks involved in the business 
 Management details and their background

- Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details
- Complete financial statements
- Management Discussion and Analysis – how the company perceives future business operations to emerge
- Risks involved in the business
- Management details and their background

- Market the IPO  – This would involve TV and print advertisements to build awareness about the company and its IPO offering. This process is also called the IPO roadshow. 
 Fix the price band  – Decide the price band between which the company would like to go public. Of course, this can’t be way off the general perception. If it is, then the public will not subscribe to the IPO 
 Book Building  – Once the roadshow is done and the price band fixed, the company has to officially open the window during which the public can subscribe for shares. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, the public can choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue. The process of collecting all these price points and the respective quantities is called Book Building. Book building is perceived as an effective price discovery method. 
 Closure  – After the book building window is closed (generally open for a few days), the price point at which the issue gets listed is decided. This price point is usually the price at which maximum bids have been received. 
 Listing Day  – This is the day when the company gets listed on the stock exchange. The listing price is the price decided based on market demand and supply on that day and the stock is listed at a premium, par, or discount of the cut-off price.

### 5.5 – What happens after the IPO?

During the bidding process, investors can bid for shares at a particular price within the specified price band.  This whole system is referred to as the Primary Market around the date of the issue where one bids for shares. The moment the stock gets listed and debuts on the stock exchange, the stock starts to trade publicly. This is called the  secondary market .

Once the stock transitions from primary to secondary markets, the stock gets traded daily on the stock exchange. People transact (buy or sell) these listed shares regularly.

Why do people trade? Why does the stock price fluctuate? We will answer all these questions and more in the subsequent chapters.




### 5.6 – Few key IPO jargon

Before we wrap up the chapter on IPOs, let us review a few important IPO jargons.

Under subscription – Let’s say the company wants to offer 100,000 shares to the public. During the book-building process, it was discovered that only 90,000 bids were received, then the issue is said to be under-subscribed. This is not a great situation, as it indicates negative public sentiment.

Oversubscription – If there are 200,000 bids for 100,000 shares on offer, then the issue is said to be oversubscribed two times (2x)

Green Shoe Option  –  Part of the issue document that allows the issuer to authorize additional shares (typically 15 percent) to be distributed in the event of oversubscription. This is also called the overallotment option.

Fixed Price IPO  – Sometimes, the companies fix the price of the IPO and do not opt for a price band. Such issues are called fixed-price IPO

Price Band and Cut off price  – A price band is a price range between which the stock gets listed. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.130, then the issue can list within the range. Let’s say it gets listed at 125; 125 is the cut-off price.




### 5.6 – Recent IPOs in India

Here is a look at a few recent IPOs in India. With all the background information you now have, reading this table should be easy.


Sl No | Name of Issue | IPO Size (INR Crs) | BRLM | Listing date |  | Price Band (INR)
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
01 | Adani Wilmar Limited | 3600 | Kotak, JP Morgan, ICIC | 8th Feb 2022 |  | 218 – 230
02 | Delhivery Limited | 5235 | Kotak, BoFA, Citi | 24th May 2022 |  | 462 – 487
03 | Ethos India | 472 | Emkay, InCred Capital | 30th May 2022 |  | 468-472
04 | Aether Industries Limited | 808 | HDFC, Kotak | 3rd June 2022 |  | 610 – 642
05 | Tracxn Technologies Limited | 310 | IIFL Securities | 20th Oct 2022 |  | 75 – 80


I hope the last two chapters gave you a sense of why a company files for an IPO and what happens during an IPO. In the next chapter, we focus on understanding the secondary markets and all the nuances around the secondary market.

- Companies go public to raise funds, provide an exit for early investors, reward employees and gain visibility. 
 Merchant banker acts as a key partner with the company during the IPO process. 
 SEBI regulates the  IPO market and has the  final word on whether a company can go public or not 
 As an investor in the IPO, you should read through the DRHP to know everything about the company. 
 Most of the IPOs in India follow a book-building process.

### 4.1 – Overview

This chapter was updated on 15th November 2022. A few comments in the query section may seem out of place. Kindly ignore those comments. The essence of the chapter remains the same.

The initial three chapters set the background on basic market concepts you need to know. It becomes necessary to address a fundamental question at this stage – Why do companies go public? A good understanding of this topic lays a sound foundation for all future topics.

In this and the next chapter, we will learn about why companies go public and, in the process, also learn a few financial concepts.




### 4.2 – Origin of a Business

Before we seek an answer as to why companies go public, let us figure out a basic concept – the origins of a typical business. We will build a familiar story around this concept to understand IPOs better. Let us split this story into several scenes to understand how the business and the funding environment evolve and the circumstances that lead a company to list in the public market.

Let us start our story. Imagine a passionate entrepreneur with a business idea – to manufacture highly fashionable, organic cotton t-shirts. The designs are unique, priced attractive, and the best quality cotton is used to manufacture these t-shirts. The entrepreneur is confident that the business will click and is enthusiastic about starting the business.

As you’d imagine, the entrepreneur will face a typical problem – how to fund the idea? Assuming the entrepreneur has no business background, he/she will not attract any serious investors initially. Chances are, the entrepreneur will approach the family and immediate friends to pitch the idea and raise some money.

Let us assume that the entrepreneur pools some of his money and convinces two good friends to invest in his business. These two friends invest in the business based on their trust in their friends. The two friends in this context are referred to as the  Angel investors.  Please note that angel money is not a loan but an investment in the business.

So let us imagine that the promoter (entrepreneur) and the angels raise INR 5 Crore in capital. This initial money the business gets to kick start operations is called  ‘The Seed Fund.’  Sometimes, it is also called a ‘Friend & Family round.’ It is important to note that the seed fund will not sit in the entrepreneur’s bank account but the company’s bank account.

Angel funding need not always come from friends; there are professional angel investors who invest money in companies that they think are good.

In return for the initial seed investment, the original three (promoter plus two angels) will be issued share certificates of the company, which entitles them to certain ownership. The only asset that the company has at this stage is cash. Hence the value of the company is only to the extent of the cash they own. In this case, the valuation is 5Crs.  Of course, one can argue that the company’s value is cash plus the company’s unique business idea, and therefore the valuation is beyond 5Crs, but we will not get into that.

Issuing shares is quite simple; the company assumes that each share is worth Rs.10, and because there is Rs.5 crore as share capital, there have to be 50 lakh shares, with each share worth Rs.10. In this context, Rs.10 is called the ‘Face value’ (FV) of the share. The face value could be any number between Rs.1 to sometimes even above Rs.10 per share as restricted by SEBI DIB guidelines to protect investors. If the FV is Rs.5, the number of shares would be one crore, and so on.

Backed by the seed fund, the promoter kick-starts business operations. The entrepreneur moves cautiously, hires the right people, establishes the right process, and starts manufacturing high-quality t-shirts. At this stage, the entrepreneur has one small manufacturing unit and one store to retail the product.

The entrepreneur’s hard work pays off, and the business generates a steady revenue stream. The company starts to break even at the end of the first two years of operations. The promoter is no longer a rookie business owner. Instead, he is more knowledgeable about the business and, of course, more confident. Backed by confidence, the promoter wants to expand the business by adding one more manufacturing unit and a few additional retail stores in the city. The entrepreneur chalks out the plan and figures out that the fresh investment needed for business expansion is INR 7 Crs.

The entrepreneur is now in a better situation when compared to two years ago. The big difference is the fact that the business is generating revenues. The healthy inflow of revenue validates the business and its offerings. The entrepreneur can now access reasonably savvy investors for investing in the business. The investor who typically invests in such an early stage of business is called a  Venture Capitalist (VC),  and the money that the business gets at this stage is called  Series A  funding.

Assume the entrepreneur raises the 7 Crs required to expand the business. Typically when new investment flows into the business, the following happens –

1. There is a dilution of shares by the promoter.
1. The valuation of the business increases
1. All the previous investors (in this case, the two angles) tend to make notional profits on their initial investment.

With the VC’s money coming into the business, the notional value (valuation) increases, and therefore, notional wealth is created for early investors.

As we advance with our story, the promoter now has the capital required for the business. As planned, the company gets an additional manufacturing unit and a few more retail outlets in the city. Things are going great; the product’s popularity is growing, translating into higher revenues. The management team gets more professional, thereby increasing operational efficiency, which translates to better profits.

Three more years pass by, and the company is phenomenally successful. The company decides to have a retail presence in at least three more cities. To back the retail presence across three cities, the company plans to increase its production capacity and hire more resources. Whenever a company plans such expenditure to improve the overall business, the expenditure is called ‘Capital Expenditure’ or simply  ‘CAPEX’.

The management estimates 40Crs towards their CAPEX requirements. How does the company get this money, or in other words, how can the company fund its CAPEX requirements?

There are a few options for the company to raise the required funds for their CAPEX:

1. The company has made some profits over the last few years; a part of the CAPEX requirement can be funded through the profits. This is also called funding through  internal accruals.
1. The company can approach another VC and raise another round of VC funding by allotting shares; if they do, it’s called  series B funding.
1. The company can approach a bank for a loan. The bank would be happy to tender this loan as the company has been doing fairly well. The loan is also called  ‘Debt.’

Assume the company exercises all three options to raise funds for Capex. It plows back 15Crs from internal accruals, plans a series B – divests some equity for a consideration of 10Crs from another VC, and raises 15Crs debt from the bank.

Note that the company’s valuation again increases with 10Crs coming in from series B. With the increase in valuations, the previous investors tend to make bigger notional profits.  Also, I would encourage you to think about the wealth created over the years. This is exactly what happens to entrepreneurs with great business ideas and a highly competent management team.

Real-world examples of such wealth creation stories are companies like Infosys, Page Industries, Eicher Motors, Titan Industries, Bajaj Finserve, HDFC Bank, and internationally, one could think of Google, Apple, Amazon, etc. The list is quite exhaustive.

A few years pass by, and the company’s success continues to grow, and with the growing success of this 8-year-old company, ambitions swell. The company decides to raise the bar and branch out across the country. They also diversify the company by manufacturing and retailing fashion accessories, designer cosmetics, and perfumes.

The CAPEX requirement to fuel the new ambition is now pegged at 60 Crs. The company does not want to raise money through debt because of the interest rate burden, also called the  finance   charges , bites into the company’s profits. For example, suppose the company generates Rs.100 as profit and pays Rs.20 towards finance charges; the profitability is reduced to Rs.80. We will discuss more on this in the Fundamental Analysis module.

The company decides on Series C funding. They cannot approach a typical VC because VC funding is usually small and runs into a few crores. This is when a  Private Equity (PE)  investor comes into the picture. Think about the PE as a big brother of a VC. Here are a few differences between a PE and VC –

1. VCs tend to cut smaller cheques, while PE typically invests large amounts.
1. VC invests in early-stage businesses and takes a much higher risk than PE. PEs invest at a mature stage and take on lesser risk compared to a VC
1. PEs, upon investment, also take up a board seat in the company and oversee the company’s functioning.

PE investors are quite savvy. They are highly qualified and have an excellent professional backgrounds. They invest large amounts of money to provide the capital for constructive use and place their people on the board of the investee company to ensure the company steers in the required direction.

Usually, when a PE invests, they invest in funding large CAPEX requirements. Besides, they do not invest in the early stage of a business; instead, they prefer to invest in companies that already have a revenue stream and have been in operation for a few years. Deploying the PE capital and utilizing the capital for the CAPEX requirements takes a few years.

Let us assume that the company raises funds via a Private Equity company and expands its business.

Fast forward 5 years after the PE investment, the company has progressed well. They have successfully diversified their product portfolio and have a presence across all the country’s major cities. Revenues are good, profitability is stable, and the investors are happy. The promoter, however, does not want to settle in for just this.

The promoter now aspires to go international! The company now wants the brand available across all the major international cities, with at least two outlets in each major city worldwide.

The company needs to invest in market research to understand the demographics of other countries, invest in people, and increase manufacturing capacities. Besides, they also need to invest in real estate space across the world. The CAPEX requirement is huge; the management estimates this at 200 Crs. The company has few options to fund the CAPEX requirement –

1. Fund Capex from internal accruals 
 Raise Series D from another PE fund 
 Raise debt from bankers 
 Float a bond (this is another form of raising debt) 
 File for an Initial Public Offer (IPO) 
 A combination of all the above
1. Fund Capex from internal accruals
1. Raise Series D from another PE fund
1. Raise debt from bankers
1. Float a bond (this is another form of raising debt)
1. File for an Initial Public Offer (IPO)
1. A combination of all the above

For convenience, let us assume the company decides to fund the CAPEX partly through internal accruals and the rest via an IPO. When a company files for an IPO, they have to offer its shares to the general public. The general public will subscribe to the shares (i.e., if they want to) by paying a certain price. Now, because the company offers the shares for the first time to the public, it is called the  “Initial Public Offer’ .

We are now at a crucial juncture where a few questions need to be answered.

1. Why did the company decide to file for an IPO? In general, why do companies go public? 
 Why did they not file for the IPO when they were in Series A, B, and C situations? 
 What would happen to the existing shareholders after the IPO? 
 What does the general public look for before they subscribe to the IPO? 
 How does the IPO process evolve? 
 Which of the financial intermediaries are involved in the IPO markets? 
 What happens after the company goes public?

1. Why did they not file for the IPO when they were in Series A, B, and C situations?
1. What would happen to the existing shareholders after the IPO?
1. What does the general public look for before they subscribe to the IPO?
1. How does the IPO process evolve?
1. Which of the financial intermediaries are involved in the IPO markets?
1. What happens after the company goes public?

In the following chapter, we will address each of the above questions plus more, and we will also give you more insights into the IPO Market. Hopefully, from this chapter, you should have developed a sense of the sequence of events that would typically drive a company to raise funds via an IPO.

1. Before understanding why companies go public, it is important to understand the origin of business.
1. The people who invest in your business in the pre-revenue stage are called Angel Investors.
1. Angel investors take the maximum risk. They take in as much risk as the promoter.
1. The money that angels give to start the business is called the seed fund.
1. Angel’s invests a relatively small amount of capital
1. The valuation of a company signifies how much the company is valued by considering the company’s assets, liabilities, and future growth prospects.
1. Face value is simply a denominator to indicate how much one share is originally worth. Face value is also called the notional value of a share.
1. The money the company spends on business expansion is called capital expenditure or CAPEX
1. Series A, B, and C are funding the company seeks as it evolves. Usually, the newer the series,  the higher the company’s valuation.
1. Beyond a certain size, VCs dont invest, and hence the company seeking investments will have to approach Private Equity firms.
1. PE firms invest large sums of money, usually at a slightly more mature stage of the business.
1. In terms of risk, PEs have a lower risk appetite as compared to VCs or angels.
1. Typical PE investors post their people on the investee company’s board to ensure business moves in the right direction.
1. The company’s valuation increases as and when the business, revenues, and profitability increase.
1. An IPO is a process using which a company can raise funds from the general public. The funds raised can be for any valid reason – for CAPEX, restructuring debt, rewarding shareholders, etc



## 2.Regulators,_the_guardians_of_capital_markets

### 2.1 – What is the stock market?

In the previous chapter, we established that investing in equities is vital to generate inflation-beating returns. Having said that, how do we go about investing in equities? Before we dwell further into this topic, it is essential to understand the market ecosystem and the many different entities involved in making our capital market journey smooth.

Just like the way we go to the neighborhood kirana store or a supermarket to shop for our daily needs, similarly, we go to the stock market to shop (read as transact) for investments. The stock market is where all the participants who wish to transact in shares go. Transact means to buy or sell shares in the context of stock markets. The primary purpose of the stock market is to help you facilitate your transactions. So if you want to buy shares of a company, the stock market helps you meet the seller and vice versa.

Unlike a supermarket, the stock market does not exist in a brick-and-mortar form. It exists in electronic form. You access the market electronically from your computer and conduct transactions (buy or sell). It is also important to note that you can access the stock market via a registered intermediary called the stockbroker. We will discuss the stockbrokers at a later point.

India has two stock exchanges – the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). There were many other exchanges earlier, but none of them survived. So when you talk about the stock markets in India, you are essentially referring to either NSE or BSE. Older stock exchanges like Bangalore Stock Exchange (BgSE), Madras Stock Exchange (MSE), Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) have either merged with BSE/NSE or shut shop.




### 2.2 – Market Participants and the need to regulate them

The stock market attracts individuals and corporations from diverse backgrounds. Anyone who transacts in the stock market is called a market participant. The market participant can be classified into various categories –

1. Domestic Retail Participants  – These are people like you and me transacting in markets 
 NRI’s and OCI  – These are people of Indian origin but based outside India 
 Domestic Institutions  – These are corporate entities in India 
 Domestic Asset Management Companies (AMC)  – Mutual fund companies like SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC AMC, Edelweiss, ICICI Pru, etc. 
 Foreign Institutional Investors  – Non-Indian corporate entities. These could be foreign asset management companies, hedge funds, and other investors.

1. Foreign Institutional Investors  – Non-Indian corporate entities. These could be foreign asset management companies, hedge funds, and other investors.

Now, irrespective of who participates in the market, the agenda for all is to make profitable transactions. More bluntly put – to make money.

When money is involved, human emotions such as greed and fear run high. One can easily fall prey to these emotions and get involved in unfair practices. India has its fair share of such unethical practices. Given this, the stock markets need someone who can set the game rules (commonly referred to as regulation and compliance) and ensure that people adhere to these regulations and compliance, thereby making the markets a level playing field for everyone.




### 2.3 – The Regulator

In India, the stock market regulator is called  The Securities and Exchange Board of India,  often referred to as SEBI. SEBI aims to promote the development of stock exchanges, protect the interest of retail investors, and regulate market participants’ and financial intermediaries’ activities. In general, SEBI ensures:

1. The stock exchange conducts its business fairly 
 Stockbrokers conduct their business fairly 
 Participants don’t get involved in unfair practices 
 Corporates don’t use the markets to benefit themselves (Satyam Computers) unduly 
 Small investors’ interests are protected 
 Large investors with mega cash piles should not manipulate the markets 
 Overall development of markets
1. The stock exchange conducts its business fairly

1. Participants don’t get involved in unfair practices
1. Corporates don’t use the markets to benefit themselves (Satyam Computers) unduly
1. Small investors’ interests are protected
1. Large investors with mega cash piles should not manipulate the markets
1. Overall development of markets

Given the above objectives, it becomes imperative for SEBI to regulate all the entities which are involved in the market. All the entities mentioned below are directly involved in the stock markets. Malpractice by any of the following entities can disrupt what is otherwise a harmonious market in India.

SEBI has prescribed a set of rules and regulations for each entity. The entity should operate within the legal framework as prescribed by SEBI. The specific rules applicable to a specific entity are made available by SEBI on its website. They are published under the ‘Legal Framework’ section of their site.


Entity | Example of companies | What do they do? | In simpler words
--- | --- | --- | ---
Credit Rating Agency (CRA) | CRISIL, ICRA, CARE | They rate the creditworthiness of corporate and governments | If a corporate (or Govt) entity wants to avail loan (debt financing), CRAs check for creditworthiness and assign a rating, the basis on which other entities can decide to extend a loan or not.
Debenture Trustees | Almost all banks in India | Act as a trustee to corporate debenture | When companies want to raise a loan, they can issue debentures against which they promise to pay interest. The public can subscribe to these debentures. A Debenture Trustee ensures that the
Depositories | NSDL and CDSL | Safekeeping, reporting, and settlement of clients’ securities | They act like a digital vault for your shares. The depositories hold your shares and facilitate the exchange of your securities. When you buy shares, these shares sit in your Depositary account, usually referred to as the DEMAT account.
Depository Participant (DP) | Most of the banks and few stockbrokers | Act as an agent to the depositories | You cannot directly interact with NSDL or CDSL. You must liaise with a DP to open and maintain your DEMAT account.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) | Foreign corporate, funds and individuals | Make investments in India | These are foreign entities with interest in investing in India. They usually transact large amounts of money, and hence their activity in the markets has an impact in terms of market sentiment.
Merchant Bankers | Karvy, Axis Bank, Edelweiss Capital | Help companies raise money in the primary markets | If a company plans to raise money by floating an IPO, then merchant bankers are the ones who help companies with the IPO process.
Asset Management Companies | HDFC AMC, Reliance Capital, SBI Capital | Offer Mutual Fund Schemes | An AMC collects money from the public, puts that money in a single account, and then invests that money in markets intending to make the investments grow and generate wealth.
Portfolio Managers/ | Capitalmind Wealth PMS, Motilal PMS, Parag Parikh PMS | Offer PMS schemes | They work similarly to a mutual fund except in a PMS; you have to invest a minimum of Rs.50,00,000; however, there is no such cap in a mutual fund.
Stock Brokers | Zerodha, Sharekhan, ICICI Direct | Act as an intermediary between an investor and the stock exchange | Stock brokers act as a gateway to the stock markets, giving electronic access to stock markets to facilitate transactions.


We will elaborate on some of these market intermediaries in the next chapter.

1. The stock market is the place to transact in equities.
1. Stock markets exist electronically and can be accessed through a stockbroker.
1. There are many different market participants operating in the stock markets.
1. Every entity operating in the market has to be regulated and can operate only within the framework prescribed by the regulator.
1. SEBI is the regulator of the securities market in India. They set the legal framework and regulate all entities interested in operating in the market.
1. Most importantly, you need to remember that SEBI is aware of what you are doing, and they can flag you down if you are up to something fishy in the markets!



## 14.Supplementary_note_–_Rights,_OFS,_FPO

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/supplementary-note-ipo-ofs-fpo/)



### IPO, OFS, and FPO – How are they different?

Initial Public Offering is when a company is introduced into the publicly traded stock markets for the first time. In the IPO, the company’s promoters choose to offer a certain percentage of shares to the public. The reason for going public and the process of an IPO is explained in detail in Chapters 4 and 5.

The primary reason for going public is to raise capital to fund expansion projects or cash out early investors. After the IPO is listed on the exchange and is traded in the secondary market, promoters of the company might still want additional capital. There are three options available: Rights Issue, Offer for Sale and Follow-on Public Offer.

The promoters can choose to raise additional capital from its existing shareholders by offering them new shares at a discounted price (generally lower than Market Price). The company offers new shares in the proportion of shares already held by the shareholders. For example, a 1:4 Rights Issue would mean that every 4 shares held 1 additional share is offered. Although this option looks good, it limits the company to raise the capital from a small number of investors who are already holding shares of the company and might not want to invest more. A rights issue leads to the creation of new shares that are offered to the shareholders, which dilutes the value of the previously held shares.

An example of a Rights issue is South Indian Bank which announced a 1:3(One share for every 3 held) issue for Rs 14 which is 30% lower than the Market Price the stock was trading (Rs 20 as on Record date 17 Feb 2017). The bank offered 45.07 lakh shares to the existing shareholders.

The rights issue is covered in detail in Chapter 11, covering key Corporate Actions.

The promoters can choose to offer the secondary issue of shares to the whole market, unlike a rights issue restricted to existing shareholders. The Exchange provides a separate window through the stockbrokers for the Offer for Sale. The exchange allows a company to route funds through OFS only if the Promoters want to sell out their holdings and/or maintain minimum public shareholding requirements (Govt. PSU have a public shareholding requirement of 25%).

There is a floor price set by the company, at or above which both Retail and Non-Retail investors can make bids. The shares are allotted, if bids are at a cut-off price or above will be settled by the exchange into the investor Demat account in T+1 days.

An example of an Offer for Sale is NTPC limited, which offered a maximum of 46.35 million shares at a floor price of Rs 168 and was fully subscribed in the 2 day period. The OFS was held on 29th August 2017 for Non-Retail Investors and 30th August 2017.

An FPO also has the same intent of raising additional capital after it has been listed but follows a different mechanism for applying and allotting shares. Shares can be diluted, and fresh shares can be created and offered in an FPO. Just like an IPO, an FPO requires that Merchant Bankers be appointed to create a Draft Red Herring Prospectus which has to be approved by SEBI after which bidding is allowed in a 3-5 day period. Investors can place their bids through ASBA and shares are allotted based on the Cut-off Price decided after the book-building process. Since the introduction of OFS in 2012, FPOs are seldom used due to the lengthy approval process.

The company decides on a Price Band, and the FPO is publicly advertised. Prospective investors can bid for the issue using the ASBA portal through Internet Banking or apply offline through a Bank Branch. After the bidding process is complete, the cut-off price is declared based on the demand and the additional shares allotted are listed on the exchange for trading in the secondary markets.

An example of an FPO is of Engineers India Ltd which underwent an issue in February 2014 with Rs 145-Rs 150. The issue was oversubscribed by 3 times. The shares on the day of the starting date of the issue were trading at Rs 151.1. The lower price band was at a 4.2% discount from the market price.

- An OFS is used to offload Promoters’ shares while an FPO is used to fund new projects.
- Dilution of shares is allowed in an FPO leading to change in Shareholding structure while OFS does not affect the number of authorized shares.
- Only the companies with a Market Capitalisation of Rs 1000 crores and above can use the OFS route to raise funds while all the listed companies can use the FPO option.
- Ever since SEBI has introduced OFS, FPO issues have come down, and companies prefer to choose the OFS route to raise funds



## 7.The_Stock_Markets_Index

### 7.1 – Overview

If I were to ask you to give me a real-time summary of the traffic situation in your city, how would you possibly do it?

Your city may have thousands of roads and junctions; it is unlikely you would check every road in the city to find the answer. The wiser thing for you to do would be to quickly check a few important roads and junctions across the city’s four directions and observe how the traffic is moving. If you observe chaotic conditions across these roads, you can conclude the traffic situation is chaotic; else, traffic can be considered normal.

The few important roads and junctions you tracked to summarize the traffic situation served as a barometer for the entire city’s traffic situation!

Drawing parallels, if I were to ask you how the stock market is moving today, how would you answer my question? There are approximately 5,000 listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange and about 2,000 on the National Stock Exchange. It would be clumsy to check every company, figure out if they are up or down for the day, and then give a detailed answer.

Instead, you would check a few important companies across key industrial sectors. If a majority of these companies are moving up, you would say markets are up; if the majority are down, you would say markets are down; and if there is a mixed trend, you would say markets are sideways or flat for the day.

So essentially, identify a few companies to represent the broader markets. Whenever someone asks you how the markets are doing, you check the general trend of these selected stocks and then answer. These companies that you have identified collectively make up the stock market index!




### 7.2 – The Index

Luckily you need not track these selected companies individually to get a sense of how the markets are doing. The important companies are pre-packaged and continuously monitored to give you this information. This pre-packaged market sentiment indicator is called the ‘Stock market Index.’

There are a few important indices in India. The  S&P BSE Sensex  represents the Bombay stock exchange, and  the Nifty 50  represents the National Stock exchange. Apart from these two, there is the  Nifty Bank Index  (Bank Nifty), which is quite popular. Bank Nifty represents the banking sector as a whole.

S&P stands for Standard and Poor’s, a global credit rating agency. S&P has the technical expertise in constructing the index they have licensed to the BSE. Hence the index also carries the S&P tag. NSE itself maintains the indices via a related company called NSE Indices Limited.

Nifty 50 consists of the most frequently traded stocks on the National Stock Exchange; we will soon discuss the methodology basis on which these indices are constructed. An ideal index gives us an updated, accurate representation of the market sentiment. The movements in the Index reflect the changing expectations of the market participants. When the index goes up, it is because the market participants think the future will be better. The index drops if the market participants perceive the future pessimistically.




### 7.3 – Practical uses of the Index

Some of the practical uses of Index are discussed below.

Information  –  The index reflects the overall sentiment and trend in the market.  The index broadly represents the country’s state of the economy. A stock market index that is up indicates people are optimistic about the future. Likewise, people are pessimistic about the future when the stock market index is down.

For example, the Nifty 50 value as of 21st November 2022 is 18150, but around six months ago, the Nifty 50 was at 15820. The index has moved 2300 points or about 14.75% higher in six months, indicating bullishness in the market. In other words, market participants have been optimistic about the Indian economic future.

The time frame for calculating the index can be for anything. For example, the Index at 9:30 AM on 21st November was 18140, but an hour later, it moved to 18099. A drop of nearly 40 within an hour. Such movement indicates that the market participants are not enthusiastic from a short-term perspective.

Benchmarking  –  A yardstick to measure the performance is required for all the trading or investing activity people do.  Assume over the last year, you invested Rs.100,000/- and generated Rs.20,000 return to make your total corpus Rs.120,000/-. How do you think you performed? Well, on the face of it, a 20% return looks great. However, what if Nifty moved to 30% during the same year?

Well, suddenly, it may seem to you that you have underperformed in the market! Usually, the objective of market participants is to outperform the Index. Now, if not for the Index, you can’t figure out how you performed in the stock market. It would be best if you had the index to benchmark the performance.

Trading  – Trading on the index is probably one of the most popular uses of the index. Majority of the traders in the market trade the index. They take a broader call on the economy or general state of affairs and translate that into a trade. The trader usually takes a short-term call on the index to trade.

For example, imagine this situation. At 10:30 AM, the Finance Minister is expected to deliver the budget speech. An hour before the announcement Nifty index is at 18,150 points. You expect the budget to be favorable to the nation’s economy. What do you think will happen to the index? Naturally, the index will move up. So to trade your point of view, you may want to buy the index at 18,150. After all, the index is the representation of the broader economy.

So as per your expectation, the budget is good, and the index moves to 18,450. You can now book your profits and exit the trade at a 300 points profit!  Trades such as these are possible through what is known as the ‘Derivative’ segment of the markets. We are probably a bit early to explore derivatives, but for now, do remember that index trading is possible through the derivative markets.

Portfolio Hedgin g  –  Investors usually build a portfolio of stocks. A typical portfolio contains 15 – 20 held for the long term. While the stocks are held from a long-term perspective, they could foresee a prolonged adverse movement in the market (ex-2008), potentially eroding the capital in the portfolio. Investors can use the index to hedge the portfolio in such a situation. We will explore this topic in a futures trading module.




### 7.4 – Index construction methodology

Knowing how the index is constructed is important, especially if one wants to advance as an index trader. As we discussed, the Index is a composition of many stocks from different sectors representing the economy’s state. To include a stock in the index, it should qualify for certain criteria. Once qualified as an index stock, it should continue to qualify on the stated criteria. If it fails to maintain the criteria, the stock gets replaced by another stock that qualifies the prerequisites.

Based on the selection procedure, the list of stocks is populated. Each stock in the index should be assigned a certain weightage. Weightage, in simpler terms, defines how much importance a certain stock in the index gets compared to the others.  For example, if ITC Limited has a 3.85% weightage in the Nifty 50 index, it is as good as saying that 3.85% of Nifty’s movement can be attributed to ITC. You can check the weights of all index stocks  here .

The obvious question is – How do we assign weights to the stock that make up the Index?

There are many ways to assign weights, but the Indian stock exchange follows a  free-float market capitalization method.  The weights are assigned based on the company’s free-float market capitalization. The larger the market capitalization, the higher the weight.

Free float market capitalization is the product of the total number of shares outstanding in the market and the stock price.

For example, company ABC has 100 shares outstanding in the market, and the stock price is at 50, then the free-float market cap of ABC is 100*50 = Rs.5,000.

At the time of writing this chapter, the following are the top 10 index heavyweight-


Sl No | Name of the company | Industry | The weightage (%)
--- | --- | --- | ---
01 | Reliance Industries Ltd | Oil & Gas | 11.03
02 | HDFC Bank Ltd | Bank | 8.26
03 | ICICI Bank Ltd | Bank | 7.94
04 | Infosys Ltd | IT | 7.06
05 | HDFC Ltd | Housing | 5.62
06 | TCS Ltd | IT | 4.1
07 | ITC Ltd | FMCG | 3.85
08 | Kotak Mahindra Bank | Bank | 3.51
09 | L&T Ltd | Infra | 3.07
10 | Axis Bank Ltd | Bank | 3.0


As you can see, Reliance Industries Ltd has the highest weightage. This means the Nifty index is most sensitive to price changes in Reliance.




### 7.5 – Sector-specific indices

While the Sensex and Nifty represent the broader markets, certain indices represent specific sectors. These are called sectoral indices. For example, the Bank Nifty on NSE represents the mood specific to the banking industry. The CNX IT on NSE represents the behavior of all the IT stocks in the stock markets. Both BSE and NSE have sector-specific indexes.  The construction and maintenance of these indices are similar to the other major indices.

1. An index acts as a barometer of the whole economy.
1. An index going up indicates that the market participants are optimistic.
1. An index going down indicates that the market participants are pessimistic.
1. There are two main indices in India – The BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50
1. An index can be used for various purposes – information, benchmarking, trading and hedging.
1. Index trading is probably the most popular use of the index.
1. India follows the free-float market capitalization method to construct the index.
1. There are sector-specific indices that convey the sentiment of specific sectors.
