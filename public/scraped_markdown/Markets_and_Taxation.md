### 5.1 – Quick Recap

Reiterating from the previous chapter –

You can classify yourself as an Investor if you hold equity investments for more than 1 year and show income as long term capital gain (LTCG). You can also consider yourself an investor and gains as short-term capital gains (STCG) if your holding period is more than 1 day and less than 1 year. We also discussed how it is best to show your capital gains as a business income if the frequency of trades is higher or if investing/trading is your primary source of income.

In this chapter, we will discuss all aspects of taxation when trading is declared as a business income, which can be categorized either as:

1. Speculative business income  – Income from intraday equity trading is considered speculative. It is considered as speculative as you would be trading without the intention of taking delivery of the contract.
1. Non-speculative business income  – Income from trading F&O (both intraday and overnight) on all the exchanges is considered non-speculative business income as it has been specifically defined this way. F&O is also considered non-speculative as these instruments are used for hedging and for taking/giving delivery of the underlying contracts. Even though currently almost all equity, currency, & commodity contracts in India are cash-settled, by definition, they give rise to giving/taking delivery (there are a few commodity futures contracts like gold and almost all agri-commodity contracts with the delivery option to it). Income from shorter-term equity delivery-based trades (held for between 1 day to 1 year) is also best considered as non-speculative business income if the frequency of such trades executed by you is high or if investing/trading in the markets is your main source of income.




### 5.2 – Taxation of trading/business income

Unlike capital gains, there is no fixed taxation rate when you have a business income. Speculative and non-speculative business income has to be added to all your other income (salary, other business income, bank interest, rental income, and others), and taxes paid according to the tax slab you fall in. You can refer to Chapter 1 for tax slabs as applicable for FY 2024-25.

Let me explain this with an example:

- My salary – Rs.1,000,000/-
- Short-term capital gains from delivery-based equity – Rs.100,000/-
- Profits from F&O trading – Rs.150,000/-
- Intraday equity trading – Rs.125,000/-

Given these incomes for the year, what is my tax liability?

In order to find out my tax liability, I need to calculate my total income by summing up my salary and all business income (speculative and non-speculative). Capital gains are not added because, unlike salary or business income, they have fixed taxation rates.

Total income (salary + business)  = Rs.1,000,000 (salary income) + Rs.150,000 (Profits from F&O trading) + Rs.125,000 (Intraday equity trading)  = Rs 1,275,000/-

As per the new tax regime, you can reduce Rs.75,000 from your income as a standard deduction before calculating your tax liability. So, I now have to pay tax on Rs 12,00,000/- based on the tax slab. If I use the new regime of filing personal taxes, this is how my tax liability looks –

- 0 – Rs.300,000 : 0% – Nil
- 300,000 – Rs.700,000: 5% – Rs.20,000/-
- 700,000 – Rs.1,000,000: 10% – Rs.30,000/-,
- 1,000,000 – 1,200,000: 15% – Rs.30,000/-
- Hence total tax : 20,000 + Rs.30,000 + Rs.30,000 =  Rs.80,000/-

Now, I also have an additional income of Rs.100,000/- classified under short-term capital gains from delivery-based equity. The tax rate on this is a flat 20%.

STCG: Rs 100,000/-, so at 20%, tax liability is  Rs.20,000/-

Total tax  = Rs.80,000 + Rs.20,000 =  Rs.100,000/-

I hope this example gives you a basic orientation of how to treat your income and evaluate your tax liability.

We will now proceed to find a list of important factors that have to be kept in mind when declaring trading as a business income for taxation.




### 5.3 – Carry forward business loss

If you file your income tax returns on time July 31 st  for non-audit case and Sept 30 th  for audit case, you can carry forward any business loss that is incurred.

Speculative losses can be carried forward for 4 years and can be set off only against any speculative gains you make in that period.

Non-speculative losses can be set-off against any other business income except salary income  the same year . So they can be set-off against bank interest income, rental income, capital gains, but only in  the same year .

You carry forward non-speculative losses to the next 8 years; however, do remember that carried forward non-speculative losses can be set-off only against any non-speculative gains made in that period.

For example, consider this – my hotel business income is Rs 1,500,000/-, my interest income for the year is Rs.200,000/-, and  I have made a non-speculative loss of Rs 700,000. In such a case, my taxable income for the year would be –

My gain is Rs 1,500,000/ from business and Rs.200,000/- from interest, so a total of Rs.1,700,000/-.

I have a non-speculative business loss of Rs.700,000/-, which I can use to offset my business gains and, therefore, lower my tax liability. Hence,

Taxable income = Rs.1,700,000 – 700,000 =  Rs.1,000,000/-

So I pay tax on Rs.1,000,000/- as per the tax slab I belong to, which would be –

- 0 – Rs.300,000 : 0% – Nil
- 300,000 – Rs.700,000: 5% – Rs.20,000/-
- 700,000 – Rs.1,000,000: 10% – Rs.30,000/-,

Hence, Rs.50,000/- goes out as tax.




### 5.4 – Offsetting Speculative and non-speculative business income

Speculative (Intraday equity) loss can’t be offset with non-speculative (F&O) gains, but speculative gains can be offset with non-speculative losses.

If you incur speculative (intraday equity) losses of Rs.100,000/- for a year and a non-speculative profit of Rs 100,000/-, then you cannot net off each other and say zero profits. You would still have to pay taxes on Rs 100,000/- from non-speculative profit and carry forward the speculative loss.

For example, consider this –

- Income from Salary = Rs.1000,000/-
- Non Speculative profit = Rs.100,000/-
- Speculative loss = Rs.100,000/-

I calculate my tax liability as –

Total income = Income from Salary + Gains from Non-Speculative Business income

= Rs.1,000,000 + Rs.100,000 =  Rs.1,100,000/-

I’m required to pay the tax on Rs.1,100,000 as per the slab rates –

- 0 – Rs.300,000 : 0% – Nil
- 300,000 – Rs.700,000: 5% – Rs.20,000/-
- 700,000 – Rs.1,000,000: 10% – Rs.30,000/-,
- 1,000,000 – Rs.1,100,000: 15% – Rs.15,000/-

Hence total tax = Rs.20,000 + Rs.30,000 + Rs.15,000 =  Rs.65,000/-

I can carry forward a speculative loss of Rs.100,000/-, which I can set off against any future (up to 4 years) speculative gains. Also, to reiterate, speculative business losses can be set off only against other speculative gains either in the same year or when carried forward. Speculative losses can’t be set off against other business gains.

But if I had a speculative gain of Rs 100,000/- and a non-speculative loss of Rs 100,000/- they can offset each other, and hence, tax in the above example would be only on the salary of Rs 1,000,000/-.




### 5.5 What is tax-loss harvesting?

Towards the end of a financial year, you might have realized profits and unrealized losses. If you let it be, you will pay taxes on realized profits and carry forward your unrealized losses to next year. This would mean a higher tax outgo immediately, and hence, any interest that you could have earned on that capital goes away as taxes.

You can very easily postpone this tax outgo by booking the unrealized loss and immediately getting back on the same trade. By booking the loss, the tax liability for the financial year would reduce.

While there is no explicit regulation in India that disallows tax loss harvesting. In the US, if stocks are sold and bought back within 30 days just to reduce taxes on realized gains, they are called  wash sales , and taxes are disallowed to be offset. Given this, it is advisable for clients trading in India to consult a CA while filing income tax returns, as they could potentially be questioned by the income tax authorities during tax scrutiny if the same stock is sold and bought back just to save on the taxes.




### 5.6 – BTST (ATST) – Is it speculative, non-speculative, or STCG?

BTST (Buy today Sell tomorrow) or ATST (Acquire today Sell tomorrow) is quite popular among equity traders. It is called BTST when you buy today and sell tomorrow without taking delivery of the stock.

Since you are not taking delivery, should it be considered speculative, similar to intraday equity trading?

There are both schools of thought, one which considers it to be speculative because no delivery was taken. However, I come from the second school, which is to consider it as non-speculative/STCG as the exchange itself charges the security transaction tax (STT) for BTST trades similar to regular delivery-based trades. A factor to consider is if such BTST trades are done just a few times in the year, show it as STCG, but if done frequently, it is best to show it as speculative business income.




### 5.7 – Advance tax – business income

Paying advance tax is important when you have a business income. Like we discussed in the previous chapter, the advance tax has to be paid every year – 15% by 15 th  Jun, 45% by 15 th  Sep, 75% by 15 th  Dec, and 100% by 15 th  March. I guess the question that will arise is % of what?

The % of the annual tax that you are likely to pay, yes! When you have business income, you have to pay most of your taxes before the year ends on March 31 st . The issue with trading as a business is that you might have a great year until September, but you can’t extrapolate this to say that you will continue to earn at the same rate until the end of the financial year. It could be more or less.

But everything said and done, you are required to pay that advance tax, otherwise, the penalty is 12% annualized for the time period it was not paid for. The best way to pay advance tax is by paying tax for that particular time period, so Sept 15th, pay for what was earned until then, and by March 15th, close to the year-end, you can make all balance payments as you would have a fair idea on how you will close the year. You can claim a tax refund if you end up paying more tax than what was required to pay for the financial year. Tax refunds are processed in a quick time by the IT department.

You can make your advance tax payments online by clicking on  Challan No./ITNS 280  on  https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/

Also, here is an interesting  link  that helps you calculate your advance tax. You can also  check this link  to see how exactly interest or penalty is calculated for non-payment of advance tax.




### 5.8 – Balance sheet and P&L statements –

When you have declared trading as a business income, you are required to like any other business to create a balance sheet and P&L or income statement for the financial year. Both these financial statements might need an audit based on your turnover and profitability. We will discuss more on this in the next chapter.




### 5.9 – Turnover and tax audit

When is an audit required?

An audit is required if you have a business income and if you have business turnover is more than Rs 10 Crores for a financial year (FY 24-25). For Equity traders, an audit is also required if they are opting out of presumptive taxation scheme as per Section 44AD and declaring a profit less than 6% of the turnover and total income is above the minimum exemption limit.

We will discuss this in detail in the next chapter.

However, let us understand what audit really means.

The dictionary meaning of the term “audit” is check, review, inspection, etc. There are various types of audits prescribed under different laws, such as company law requiring a company audit, cost accounting law requiring a cost audit, etc. Likewise, the Income Tax Law requires the taxpayer to get the audit of the accounts of his business/profession from the viewpoint of Income Tax Law if he meets the above-mentioned turnover criteria.

Check this  link for FAQ’s on tax audit  on the income tax website for more.

An audit can also be defined as having an accountant verify if you have prepared all your accounts right. In this case, it is getting an accountant to check if you have created a correct balance sheet and P&L statement for the year. Ideally, this audit should be done by the IT department itself, but considering the number of balance sheets out there, it is surely impossible for the IT department to audit each one of them. Hence we need a Chartered accountant (CA), who is a qualified professional and authorized by the Income-tax department to perform audits on the balance sheet and P&L statements. You, the taxpayer, can use any CA of your choice.

What role should a CA play?

Ideally, a CA is required to only audit and sign on the balance sheets and P&L statements. But a CA also typically ends up creating your balance sheets and P&L statements and will audit them only if required.  We will, in the next chapter, briefly explain how a CA typically creates these two statements.

The importance of the audit process by a CA cannot be understated. Apart from all the reporting requirements, an audit also helps traders/investors know their financial health, ensure it faithfully reflects the income, and ensure claims for deduction are correctly made. It also helps lenders evaluate credibility and act as a check for any fraudulent practices.

Which ITR form to use? – ITR3 (ITR 4 until 2016), we will discuss this in more detail in the last chapter. I have come across incidents where people have declared both speculative and non-speculative as capital gains to avoid having to declare business income and not having to use ITR3. Taking a shortcut like this could mean a lot of trouble if called for IT scrutiny.

Business expenses when trading –  The advantage of showing trading as a business is that you can show all expenses incurred as a cost, which can then be used to reduce your tax outgo, and if a net loss for the year after all these costs, it can be carried forward as explained above.

Following are some of the expenses that can be shown as a cost when trading

- All trading charges (STT, Brokerage, Exchange charges, and all other taxes). I hope you remember that STT can’t be shown as a cost when declaring income as capital gains, but it can be in the case of business income.
- Internet/phone bills if used for trading (portion proportionate to your usage on the bill)
- Depreciation of computers/other electronics (used for trading)
- Rental expense (if the place is used for trading, if a room is used – a portion of your rent)
- Salary paid to anyone helping you trade
- Advisory fees, cost of books, newspapers, subscriptions, and more.




### Key takeaways from this chapter

## 7.ITR_Forms_(The_Finale)

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/itr-forms/)



### 7.1 – Income Tax Return (ITR) Forms

The last step of taxation is filing your Income tax returns (ITR), and this can be done using ITR forms. Find below a brief explanation of everything important on ITR that you need to know as an investor/trader.

I have noticed from my interactions with many that they are confused between the two actions i.e ‘paying income tax’ and ‘filing income tax’. Many are of the opinion that if they pay income tax the act of filing income tax is not really necessary. This is not true, let me explain why.

Paying Income tax  – If you are employed and draw a salary you very clearly know that your employer on your behalf deducts tax (based on your tax slab) and pays the income tax on your behalf. This is usually called ‘ Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) ’. Now, what if you have an income source besides your salary?

For example for the given year assume besides drawing a salary, you also made a profit by actively trading delivery based equity trading. As we now know this activity falls under “Non-speculative Business Income”. Since the employer is not privy to this activity it becomes your responsibility to declare this source of income to the Income-tax department and paying the appropriate amount as tax.

Filing Income tax returns  – Filing income tax returns is a mandatory way of communicating to the IT department all the sources of income you have including your salary. An  Income Tax Return Form (ITR)  form is simply a form that you need to fill up declaring your sources of income. There are different ITR forms for different sources of income. You may wonder why I should file my returns when I don’t have any other source of income besides salary. Well, in such a case by virtue of filing your income tax returns (via appropriate ITR form) you are officially communicating to the income tax department that you do not have any other source of income.

So in essence, the act of filing your returns is your official communication to the IT department about all the sources of income that you have along with the tax you have paid against that income. You do this via the prescribed  ITR forms .

More formally, an ITR is a prescribed form through which the particulars of income earned by a person in a financial year and taxes paid on such income are communicated to the Income-tax Department. There are different types of ITR forms, one needs to select the appropriate ITR form, based on the different sources of income. These forms can be downloaded from here  https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/




### 7.2 – Different ITR forms

In the context of this module, which is focused on individuals having investments as capital gains or trading as a business income, the important ITR forms to know about are:

ITR 1  – when you earn a salary, interest income, or rental income from only one house property, you can use ITR 1 forms to file your income tax returns (total income up to Rs 50lks). This is the most common type, but if you have capital gains or trading as a business income, you can’t use this ITR form.

ITR 2  – for individuals and HUF not carrying out any business/profession and when you have a salary, interest income, income from house property or  income from capital gains , you can use ITR 2. So if you are an individual who only invests in the market (remember investor, hence capital gains), you need to use ITR2

ITR 3(ITR 4 renamed to ITR3 from 2017)  – when you have a salary, interest income, income from house property, income from capital gains, and income from business/profession, you can use ITR 3.

So if you are an individual who is declaring trading as a business income, you have to use ITR 3. If you are an investor and trader, you can show trading under business income and investments as capital gains on the same ITR 3 form.

ITR 4 (ITR 4S earlier)  – this is similar to ITR3 but with a presumptive scheme, if section 44AD and 44AE used for computation of business income. ITR 4 can’t be used to declare any capital gains or if losses have to be carried forward.  So you can use ITR 4 only if you have business income (speculative + non-speculative), but it is best avoided if by use of this form you are reducing your tax liability.




### 7.3 – Exploring ITR 4 (4S until 2017)

The advantage of ITR 4 is that it can be used by taxpayers who do not maintain a regular book of accounts or want it to be audited (refer chapter 2) provided your turnover is lesser than Rs 10 Crores for the year.

You can get away without maintaining books or getting audited if you firstly calculate turnover based on section 44AD ( check the previous chapter ) and then declare 6%* of this turnover as your presumptive income. You have to then pay taxes adding this 6%* of the turnover to your other income and pay tax as per the slabs.

To opt for Section 44AD, the maximum turnover should be Rs 2 Crores until FY2022-23; from FY 2023-24; the threshold limit has been increased to Rs 3 Crores provided 95% of the receipts are by way of digital mode.

You will not be able to opt for 44AD; if you are declaring more than 3 Crore.

So if you are a trader with turnover less than Rs 10 Crores for the year (was Rs 1 crore until FY 19/20) and profit less than 6%* of the turnover with only business income (not possible if you have capital gains), you can declare presumptive income of 6%* of the turnover, and get away from the need to get your books audited.  You need to pay Advance Tax only for the 4 th  Quarter i.e 15 th  March installment.

For example, assume my salary was Rs.500,000/- for the last FY, and I had incurred F&O loss of Rs.25,000/- on a turnover of Rs.400,000/-. Since my profit is less than 6%* (25,000/400,000) of my turnover I will need to use ITR4, maintain books, and have them audited. Instead of this, I could use ITR4S and declare 6%* of Rs.400,000/- (business turnover) or Rs.24,000/- as my presumptive trading business income even though I have incurred a loss.

Update :   % is reduced from 8% to 6% from AY 2017/18 or FY 2016/17

My total income for the year is Rs 500,000 (salary) + R 24,000 (business income) = Rs.524,000/-. Therefore my tax liability would be as follows –

Upto Rs.250,000 – No Tax

Between Rs.250,000 to Rs.500,000 – 5% – Rs.12,500/-

Between Rs.500,000 to Rs.524,000 – 20% –    Rs.4,800/-

Total tax = Rs.12,500 + Rs.4,800 = Rs.17,300/-

Here, by virtue of declaring a presumptive business income of Rs.24,000/- I’m paying an additional tax of Rs.4,800/-. This works out to be a cheaper alternative than getting an audit done for which the CA fees could have been Rs.15,000/- and above. So using ITR4 would make sense only if your turnover is low, hence declaring 6% of turnover as income would work out cheaper than paying an audit fee to the CA.




### 7.4 – Exploring ITR 3

ITR 3

ITR 3 is a comprehensive ITR form. As said above, it is applicable when you have all heads of incomes say, salary; income from house property; capital gains; income from business or profession and income from other sources (say interest income).

Declaring FNO Income under presumptive scheme (44AD)

From FY 2018-19 onwards, one can use ITR-3 even when he or she wants to declare business income under presumptive scheme. The income tax department has inserted the option to declare income presumptive scheme in Schedule PL. Hence, traders can make use of it. One can use this form to declare capital gains or capital losses or if losses have to be carried forward and any interest income.

As shown in the above image, assume the turnover in Rs 1Cr – one can declare 6% on Turnover i.e Rs 6Lacs profit and pay tax accordingly as per applicable slab rate.

Further, you can set off current year losses and the brought forward business losses against this presumptive income (Rs 6Lacs). You can also claim deductions under Chapter VI-A Part B i.e 80C to 80GGC. These eligible deductions will reduce your income further which in turn taxes as well. We will discuss more on this in upcoming chapters.

Consider this example:

- Income from Business: Rs 6Lacs (as above)
- Loss from House Property: Rs 1.5 Lacs
- Carry forward business loss from previous years: Rs50K
- Investment eligible under 80C: Rs 50K

Taxable income will be 3.5Lacs.

What did I do?

I set off F&O Income of 6Lacs with loss from house property (interest paid on housing loan) and business loss from previous years.

Net business income after set off becomes Rs 4Lacs. I further reduced it by 50K which makes taxable income: Rs 3.5Lacs.

Important note: Once you opt out of the presumptive scheme in a financial year, you cannot declare income/take benefit under this scheme for next 5 years.

Say, you declare F&O income under presumptive scheme (44AD) for FY 2022-23 and for FY 2023-24 assume you incur losses and you decide to carry forward such F&O losses. Thus, you opt out of 44AD and declare loss under normal provisions of the income tax act.

Suppose, in FY 2024-25 you make profit and if you decide to declare F&O profits under the presumptive scheme; you can’t for FY 2024-25 and until FY 2028-29.

Further, assume you declare income under presumptive scheme for FY 2022-23 as you see in Image 1 and next year i.e FY 2023-24 you decide to declare less than 6% under normal provisions and your total taxable income is more than basic exemption limit, then tax audit is applicable and you are required to maintain books of account.

This applies for 5 consecutive years from where you opt out of presumptive scheme – which means say; you opt out of presumptive in FY 2023-24 and for FY 2024-25 to FY 2028-29

1. you are required to get audit done
1. you are required to maintain books of account 
 if your total income exceeds the basic exemption limit.

Hence one should be careful before switching into or switching out of presumptive scheme.

One who opts for presumptive scheme has to pay whole advance tax in one go on or before 15 th  March of the Financial Year.

44AD is not applicable for a Non-Resident. 
 Declaring FNO Income under normal provisions i.e maintaining books (to carry forward loss)

What are normal provisions?

Normal provisions means a tax payer or trader is required maintain books of accounts i.e Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss account unlike in presumptive scheme where you one need not maintain books of account.

Consider the following example:

I have entered the sell value of and option premiums and sale value of futures under Point 4(image 3) since there is no option to exclusively declare the sale details of FNO.

Next, I have entered the buy value of options premium and futures under Point 9(image 3).

If you see, there is a loss of Rs 83,329/-

As part of expenses, you can claim all the expenses attributable to earning the FNO Income. Some of the examples:

- Salaries, if you have people helping you trade.
- Rent, if you are using a dedicated office for the trading activity.
- Brokerage charges, taxes, and all other trade-related expenses.
- Advisory fees, consultancy, depreciation of laptop, and etc.

After the calculation of net profit or loss, you will pay tax as per applicable slab rates.

Trading options is considered as a non-speculative business income irrespective of being intraday or delivery.

Declaring Speculative Income:

Speculative Incomes basically consists of intraday gains as most of them are leverage based trades and done without the intention of taking delivery.

You need to declare the speculative income in the Schedule PL.

As shown above, I have filled indicative figures to a give a perspective. These speculative gains are taxed based on slab rates which you fall.

Declaring Capital Gains:

Short-Term Capital Gains:

Capital gains are declared in Schedule CG and 112A. Short Term Capital gains are straight away declared in Schedule CG and Long Term capital gains are declared in Schedule 112A.

Refer above; I have details of Short Term Capital Gains (again indicative figures) in Schedule CG.

Example:

Sale Consideration: Rs 1 Lacs

Cost (Purchase Price): Rs 90K

Expenses: Rs 1K

Short Term Capital Gain: 9K

Long Term Capital Gains: LTCG are taxed @ 10%/12.5% depending upon the date of sale on or after 23 rd  July 24 exceeding Rs 1.25 Lacs

Continued…

Consider this example:

Assume I have purchased 30 shares before 31 st  Jan 2018 @ Rs 535.56 and 50 shares after 31 st  Jan 2018 @ Rs 412.96. I have sold entire 80 shares in April 2024.

For shares purchased before 31 st  Jan 2018, grandfathering clause shall apply and there will be no tax on gains accrued upto 31 st  January 2018.  Refer #1 – since FMV as of 31st Jan 2018 is more than the sale price of (Rs 611.94), there is no question of capital gain, and since the gain is already accrued – it is exempt, and you can see in column 14, it is ZERO.

In #2, the grandfathering clause shall not apply, and the capital gain of Rs 9949/- (Rs 30597 minus Rs 20648) is calculated accordingly and taxed @ 10%/12.5% as applicable, exceeding Rs 1.25 Lacs.

The highest Price quoted on 31 st  Jan 2018 shall be considered as FMV on 31 st  Jan 2018.

Refer to this  link  – you will get the FMV details of all the shares as of 31st Jan 2018.

In ITR 2, you need to declare the capital gains in the schedules CG and 112A, as discussed above.

 The income-tax department has established an independent portal for e-filing of return of income. You can log on to www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in for e-filing the return of income. Check  this very nice video  on e-filing put by the IT department.

Is it necessary to attach documents along with the return of income? 
 ITR return forms are attachment-less forms. Hence along with the ITR form (whether filed manually or filed electronically), you are not required to attach any document (like proof of investment, TDS certificates, etc) unless if you fall under the audit case.

However, these documents should be retained by you and should be produced before the tax authorities when demanded in situations like assessment, inquiry, scrutiny, etc. But in audit cases, a soft copy of the balance sheet, P&L, and any notes along with the audit report needs to be attached.

What is the difference between e-payment and e-filing? 
 E-payment is the process of electronic payment of tax (i.e., by net banking or SBI’s debit/credit card)

E-filing is the process of electronically furnishing (filing) of return of income.

Using the e-payment and e-filing facility, payment of tax and furnishing of return is quick, easy, and hassle-free.

Is it necessary to file the return of income when I do not have any positive income? 
 If you have sustained a loss in the financial year, which you propose to carry forward to the subsequent year for adjustment against subsequent year(s) positive income, you must make a claim of loss by filing your return before the due date.

What are the due dates for filing returns of income/loss? 
 If no audit: July 31 st

If audit: September 30 th

What is to be mentioned as the “nature of business” on ITR 3 (ITR 4 until 2017)?

Nature of business can be mentioned as Trading-Others (Code: 0204) – until 2017

For FY 2017/18, Code: 13010 – Financial intermediation/Investment activities. This seems to be the closest category to investment/trading related activity.

If I fail to furnish my return within the due date, will I be fined or penalized? 
 Yes, if you have not furnished the return within the due date, you will have to pay interest on tax due. Also penalty under Section 234F of Rs 1,000/- if income is less than or equal to Rs 5 Lacs and Rs 5,000/- for taxable income above Rs 5 Lacs.

How to show profit and loss on the balance sheet?

You can show all positive turnover as gross receipts, and negative turnover as gross sales.

Can a return be filed after the due date? 
 Yes, you can. Return filed after the prescribed due date is called a belated return. If one could not file the return of income on or before the prescribed due date, then he can file a belated return. A belated return can be filed within a period of one year from the end of the financial year or before completion of the assessment, whichever is earlier. A belated return attracts interest and penalty as discussed in the previous FAQ.

For Example – In the case of income earned during FY 2022-23, the belated return can be filed up to 31st Dec 2023. However, one can file an updated return under Section 139(8A) after 31st Dec 2023, with additional penalty of 25% of additional tax(tax plus interest) within 12 months from the end of the relevant Assessment Year.

Penalty will be 50% of additional tax(tax plus interest) if updated return is filed within 24 months from the end of the relevant Assessment Year.

Sample ITR3 Form (2022-23)

Sample ITR4 Form (2022-23)

Sample Computation

1. The act of paying your taxes is called “Tax Payment”, which can be done via e-payment
1. The act of communicating different sources of income and tax paid against that is called “Income Tax Return filing”
1. Filing income tax returns is mandatory, even though you have paid taxes
1. An ITR form should be used to file taxes
1. Use different ITRs for different sources of income
1. ITR 4S for presumptive business income. Use this to lower your cash outflow (paying taxes versus audit fees)

Phew! That brings us to the end of the taxation module. Keeping it simple is most challenging, especially a topic like this where almost every other word is a jargon. Hopefully, I have done a decent job with it, and this module acts as your ready reckoner for everything on taxation when trading and investing.

Financial discipline is the key to long term wealth creation, and it starts with the compliant filing of your income tax returns. It is best not to avoid or postpone especially with the advancement of technology and reach of our income tax department.

## 8.Foreign_Stocks_and_Taxation

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/foreign-stocks-and-taxation/)

In the previous chapters, you learned how investing and trading in the Indian stock market are taxed as per the Income Tax Act. We also touched upon maintaining books of accounts and rules of the tax audit.

Those chapters were written by  @Nithin Kamath  himself, that too, from an investor/trader’s perspective, giving you a clear picture of Indian markets and taxation.

In this chapter, I,  @Satya Sontanam , look at how investments in foreign stocks are taxed in India.

If you think the tax rules of Indian investments are overwhelming, tax laws for foreign investments can get tricky and complicated.

The main challenge comes when the investments are taxed in a foreign country as well. On top of it, the tax laws of all countries differ from one another.

Here, we tried to simplify as much as we could to give you a brief understanding of what to consider when it comes to taxing income from foreign assets. We focus on investments in the stock market abroad and not on other forms of assets, including real estate.




### 8.1 – First Things First: Rules for Global Investing

When we hear about a few international stocks like Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Alphabet, it is totally natural to want to own a piece of these companies, isn’t it?

Lately, Indian investors have caught on to buying international stocks and diversifying their portfolios.

But how to invest in these stocks?

Many fintech platforms in India made investing in some of the foreign country’s stocks and ETFs (exchange-traded funds) simpler for retail investors compared to a few years ago.

But here’s the thing, investing in international stocks isn’t as straightforward as dealing with the Indian stock market. There are a few rules we have to keep in mind before taking the leap.

First, your overseas investments fall under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). This is a scheme by the Indian government that lets you send up to 2.5 lakh dollars annually abroad. That’s about Rs 2 crore in Indian currency at the current exchange rate of Rs 82. So, you must keep your investments, along with other foreign trip expenses, abroad education costs, etc.. within that limit.

Next comes the tax collection at source (TCS) at 20% (5% before October 2023) if your foreign spending or investments exceed Rs 7 lakh per year. (Update: the Rs 7 lakh limit has been increased to Rs 10 lakh from FY25 onwards)

That is, even before you invest Rs 100, a tax of Rs 20 is deducted, and the balance is invested. Of course, you can use that Rs 20 to set off with your other tax liability later that year or claim a refund. To give some relief, Budget 2024 made it easier for salaried employees to offset TCS with TDS on their salary. For example, if you have a TCS credit of Rs 1 lakh and the TDS on your salary is around Rs 3 lakh a year, you can provide all the details to your HR, who will offset the TCS with your TDS liability. This results in only Rs 2 lakh being deducted during the financial year. This is a positive for taxpayers as the money deducted as TCS doesn’t get stuck with the government for a long time.

Next is about remittance: When you sell your investments, any money you get from the sale must be brought back to India within 180 days unless invested back. Funds can’t lie idle in foreign bank accounts.

Oh, and one more thing: when you file your income tax return in India, do not forget to disclose your foreign assets separately. The income tax department wants to know about all your global assets.

Remember that these restrictions apply when buying foreign stocks or ETFs directly. If you do not want to deal with LRS, TCS, tax disclosure, and remittance rules, you can also invest through Indian mutual funds in select international stocks and ETFs.




### 8.2 – Residency Status

An Indian  resident  must pay taxes on his/her global income, the taxman says.

What does it mean? If you are an Indian resident, you have to pay taxes on any income you earn, whether from India or abroad – be it in the US, UK, Australia, Singapore, or any other country.

But if you are a  non-resident , the Indian government does not care about your foreign income. Our friends and family residing abroad investing there would not pay any taxes in India, right?

The taxman has specific rules to decide who is a resident and who is not. Basically, it depends on the period of stay in India. The definition of ‘resident’ is a bit technical. You can refer to the definition in the annexure to this chapter at the end to understand who qualifies as a resident.

The simplistic explanation is that if you are like many –  live and work in India – and take occasional trips abroad – you are a resident.




### 8.3 – Tax In India

When it comes to investments in stocks, there are two types of income to consider: capital gains and dividends.

Let’s talk about capital gains first. The taxability of capital gains depends on the holding period of the stocks. If you hold foreign company shares for more than 24 months, the gains are considered long-term capital gains and are taxed at 12.5% (plus applicable surcharge and cess).

On the other hand, if you hold the shares for up to 24 months, any resulting gains are considered short-term capital gains. These are added to your total income and taxed according to the applicable slab rates.

Now, let’s consider an example to understand how this works. Suppose you invested Rs. 1,00,000 in foreign stocks on April 1, 2018, which was equivalent to, say, $1,500.

When you sold your investment on August 31, 2024, say, you received $2,500.

As the stocks are held for more than 24 months, it qualifies for a long-term capital gains tax rate of 12.5%.

For tax purposes in India, you need to convert the sale amount into Indian rupees. You must use the exchange rate (telegraphic transfer buying rate provided by the State Bank of India) on the last day of the month prior to the month in which the sale happened.

In our example, since the sale happened in August, take the exchange rate at the end of July 2024. It was Rs. 83.7.

So, your sale value, as per Indian tax rules, would be about Rs. 2.09 lakh (Rs. 83.7 * $2,500).

Next, let’s calculate the taxable capital gains: Capital gains = Rs. 1,09,250 (Rs. 2,09,250 – Rs. 1,00,000).

Therefore, tax to be paid = Rs 1,09,250*12.5%, about Rs 13,656.

The above mentioned tax rates are applicable for shares that are sold on or after July 23 rd , 2024, when Budget 2024 changed the rules. For shares sold between 1 st  April 2024 and July 22 nd  2024, LTCG is taxed at 20% (with indexation benefit) and STCG is taxed at slab rates. The holding period is the same at 24 months.

Moving on to dividend income, it is treated as ‘income from other sources’ that has to be added to the taxpayer’s total income.

Just like with capital gains, you need to convert dividend income into Indian rupees using the exchange rate on the last day of the month prior to the month you received the dividend.

This will be added to your total income and taxed at your slab rate.

So far, we have discussed tax on investing in foreign stocks.

If you invest in foreign ETFs listed outside India directly or Indian mutual funds that are investing primarily in foreign stocks/ETFs, different tax rates are applicable based on the purchase date and the date on which the units are redeemed.

For units bought after April 1, 2023, any capital gains made during the financial year FY25 (April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025) will be taxed at your income tax slab rate, no matter how long you held the investment. However, starting from April 1, 2025, new tax rules apply:

- If you hold units for 24 months or more, Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) will be taxed at 12.5% without indexation.
- Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG), for units held less than 24 months, will still be taxed at your income tax slab rate.

However, if you had invested in Indian-listed ETFs in foreign securities, the time period to differentiate between short—and long-term gains would be 12 months, with LTCG taxed at 12.5% and STCG at the slab rate. This rule, too, is applicable from April 1, 2025, onwards.




### 8.4 – Foreign Tax

Don’t breathe easy just yet. The toughest nut to crack is up next.

Just like non-residents investing in India are taxed in India, Indians investing abroad might face taxation in the foreign country too. You might wonder why you have to pay taxes twice, right?

Well, most governments, too, agree that taxing income twice isn’t fair.

The Indian government offers relief if you are taxed abroad. You might either be exempted from tax in India or receive a tax credit that you can use to pay your taxes here. To figure out which one applies, we have to dig into the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) that India has with other countries.

Now, if finance stuff is not your cup of tea, these agreements can be pretty overwhelming, especially on the first read. You will need the expertise of a tax consultant to decipher it all.

Your broker or fintech platform might provide tax details on your investments, but you would be better off understanding how it works.

In many DTAA treaties, India follows the credit method to avoid double taxation. This means they give credit for taxes paid in the foreign country. This can set off tax liability on the same income in India. You can claim this credit by submitting Form 67 when filing the income tax return.

Let’s take the example of DTAA with the US-

For capital gains, the DTAA between the US and India states that each country may tax as per the provisions of its domestic law. This implies that both countries can charge tax.

But the US income tax laws do not charge capital gains tax on non-residents. So, the gains of Indians on US stocks are taxed only in India; hence, no double taxation.

Now, dividends. As per the DTAA between the US and India, dividends received from a US company are taxed only in India.

But here comes the catch – there’s a 25% withholding tax on gross dividends in the US. That means 25% is deducted at the source by the US, and you get the rest in your account.

No matter how much you receive, the entire gross dividend (converted into Indian rupees) will be taxed in India. In such cases, you need to submit Form 67 to claim credit for the withholding tax paid in the US.

Remember, these DTAA provisions and available tax credits can vary from country to country. If you are investing in countries other than the US and your broker isn’t helping with precise information, consider consulting your tax advisor. They will guide you through this tax maze!




### 8.5 – Reporting Of Foreign Assets In ITR

If you hate paperwork and endless documentation, reporting foreign assets and income in your tax return won’t be a walk in the park.

As a resident, you must disclose all foreign assets, like bank and depository accounts, stocks etc., held outside India while filing your income tax return. But if you fail to disclose them, you’ll face penalties and possibly even imprisonment under the provisions of Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015.

The income tax returns have dedicated schedules to fill in the detail of foreign assets, including foreign stocks.

As of now, there are three schedules (FSI, FA and TR) and one form (Form 67 discussed above to claim credit for tax paid abroad). Select the correct ITR form to fill in these details.

While we cannot discuss every aspect of these schedules, here are a few key points to keep in mind before reporting foreign assets and income. Note that these details are as per the rules as of FY23.

1. The calendar  year is relevant for reporting, while the financial year matters for taxing the income. So, don’t mix them up!

Here’s an example –

Say, you bought a stock of Microsoft in September 2022, which issued a dividend in November 2022. Take a share of another company – Alphabet – which was bought in January 2023 that gave dividends in March 2023.

For reporting assets and income for FY23, calendar Year 2022 would be applicable.

Microsoft stock :  You bought the stock in September 2022. Since the purchase was made in the calendar year 2022, you would need to disclose this investment in your income tax return for the financial year 2022-2023. Even if you sell the company as of the date of filing the return, you still must report it as you held the company at least for a day in the year 2022. If the stock was bought in 2021 or before, and you own it at least for a day in 2022, you still have to report it in the ITR.

The dividend from the stock, which was received in November 2022, has to be reported in schedules as it was received in calendar year 2022. The dividend amount has to be considered for taxability in FY23 since it falls within the financial year period from April 2022 to March 2023.

Alphabet stock :  You bought the stock in January 2023. As you do not hold the stock in the calendar year 2022, you do not need to disclose this investment in the schedules.

The dividend from Alphabet stock received in March 2023 would be considered for taxability in 2022-2023 (FY23). But it need not be disclosed in schedules as it was not received in the calendar year 2022.

Income earned from assets held outside India will be taxable as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, even if it is not required to be disclosed in schedules.

1. The schedules may ask for details such as peak balance, opening balance, closing balance, and amount debited and credited from the accounts and assets you have abroad. Keep all the details handy.

1. You also need to provide the tax details paid in the other country and how much you are claiming as a tax credit in India.

1. To report details in schedules, the rate of exchange for conversion is the telegraphic transfer buying rate of the foreign currency on the specified dates. While most of these details could be provided by the fintech platform through whom you are buying the stocks, always do your due diligence.

1. If your total income exceeds Rs 50 lakh per annum, you may also need to provide details of assets (Indian and foreign) held as on March 2023 again in ‘Schedule AL.’

Annexure

Definition of  ‘Resident’  as per the Income Tax Act

A taxpayer will qualify as a resident of India if he/she satisfies one of the following two conditions:

1. Stayed in India for 182 days or more in a financial year;  or
1. Stayed in India for at least 60 days in the financial year and 365 days or more in the immediately four preceding years

If you are a citizen of India or a person of Indian origin who leaves India for employment or visits India during a financial year, the conditions are a bit different and also depend if your total income from India is more or less than Rs 15 lakh in that year.

Further, if an Indian citizen is considered ‘stateless’ and earns a total income in India exceeding Rs 15 lakh during a financial year, he/she will be treated as a resident in India for that year.

For example, say you are an Indian citizen who works in a country where people are not subjected to income tax as per local tax laws (For example, UAE). If your income from India during the financial year exceeds Rs 15 lakh, you will be considered a deemed resident in India, even if you haven’t set foot in India throughout the year.

1. Direct investing in foreign stocks is not as straightforward as investing in the Indian stock market. You need to take into account the LRS, TCS, remittance to India and disclosure rules. 
 If you are a ‘resident’ in India, your global income (including gains and dividends from foreign stocks) is taxed in India. 
 If you are taxed on those profits in the foreign country as well, you can claim either an exemption or get a tax credit in India on the same income while filing the income tax return. 
 Whether an exemption or tax credit is known only by checking the double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) entered by India with the other country. This may need an expert’s help to .understand the rules. 
 Do not forget to disclose your foreign assets separately in the ITR. The income tax department wants to know about all your global assets.

## 6.Turnover,_Balance_Sheet,_and_P&L

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/turnover-balance-sheet-and-pl/)



### 6.1 – Turnover & Tax Audit

In the previous chapter, we discussed briefly on tax audit, and when it is required if you are declaring trading as a business income. To determine if an audit is required or not, we need to first determine the turnover of your trading business.

Reiterating – the requirement of calculating turnover arises only when treating trading P&L as a business income (An audit is not required if you only have capital gains income irrespective of the turnover). Turnover is only to determine if a tax audit is required or not.  Your tax liability does not get affected by your turnover .

An audit is required if –

- Rs 10 Crores mark  – Turnover for the year crosses the Rs 10 crores. Note that the Rs.10 Crore limit is applicable to the financial year  2023 – 2025 . This is in the case of digital transactions, and stock market trading is 100% digital.
- Section 44AD  –  if you are opting out of Section 44AD (Presumptive Taxation) in the current year and FNO Income is less than 6% of the turnover and overall income is more than the basic exemption limit.

I am sure the first thing that came to your mind after reading turnover is contract turnover, i.e

- Nifty is at 8000, you buy 100 Nifty
- Buy-side value = 8000 * 100 = Rs.800,000/-
- Nifty goes to 8100, you square off the 100 Nifty
- Sell-side value = 8100 * 100 = Rs,810,000/-
- Turnover = Buy-side value + Sell-side value = 800,000 + 810,000 =  1,610,000/-

But it is  not  the contract turnover the IT department is interested in; they are interested in your  business turnover .

Read below on how business turnover can be calculated –

The method of calculating turnover is a debatable issue and what makes it a grey area is that there is no guideline as such from the IT department. One article of great help, though, is the guidance note on tax audit under Section 44AB by ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the governing body for CA’s). The article on  Page 15, Section 5.10 of this guidance note  has a guideline on how turnover can be calculated. It says:

- Delivery based transactions

For all delivery based transactions, where you buy stocks and hold it more than 1 day and sell them, the total value of the sales is to be considered as turnover. So if you bought 100 Reliance shares at Rs 800 and sold them at Rs 820, the selling value of Rs 82000 (820 x 100) can be considered as turnover.

But remember that the above calculation of turnover for delivery trades is only applicable if you are declaring equity delivery based trades also as a business income. If you are declaring them as capital gains or investments, there is no need to calculate turnover on such transactions. Also, there is no need for an audit if you have only capital gains irrespective of turnover or profitability.

- Speculative transactions (intraday equity trading)

For all speculative transactions, the aggregate or absolute sum of both positive and negative differences from trades is to be considered as a turnover. So if you buy 100 shares of Reliance at 800 in the morning and sell at 820 by afternoon, you make a profit or positive difference of Rs 2000, this Rs.2000 can be considered as turnover for this trade.

- Non-speculative transactions (Futures and options)

For all non-speculative transactions, the article says that turnover to be determined as follows –

- The total of favourable and unfavourable differences shall be taken as turnover
- Premium received on sale of options  is also  to be included in turnover. H owever, where the premium received is included for determining net profit for transactions, the same should not be separately included.
- With respect to any reverse trades entered, the difference thereon should also form part of the turnover.
- In case of an open position as at the end of the financial year (i.e., trades that are not squared off during the same financial year), the turnover arising from the said transaction should be considered in the financial year when the transaction has been actually squared off.
- In the case of delivery-based settlement in a derivatives transaction, the difference between the trade price and the settlement price shall be considered turnover.

So if you buy 25 units or 1 lot of Nifty futures at 24,000 and sell at 23,900, Rs.2500 (25 x 100) the negative difference or loss on the trade is the turnover.

In options, if you buy 100 or 4 lots of Nifty 26,000 calls at Rs.1,000 and sell at Rs.1,010. Firstly, the favourable difference or profit of Rs 1000 (10 x 100) is the turnover. So, the total turnover on this option trade = Rs 1000.

The above calculations (points 1 to 3) are fairly straightforward; the next important thing to decide though is if you want to calculate turnover scrip-wise or trade-wise.

Scrip-wise  is when you calculate the turnover by collating all trades on the particular contract/scrip for the financial year, find average buy/sell value, and then determine the turnover using the above 3 rules with the total profit/loss or favourable/unfavourable difference on this average price.

Trade-wise  is when you calculate the turnover by summing up the absolute value of profit and loss of every trade done during the year and following the above rules.

Let me explain both with some examples –

1. 100 Nifty Oct future bought at 26,000 and sold at 26,100 on 1 st Oct.  Another 100 Nifty Oct future bought at 26,100 and sold at 26,050 on 10 th  Oct. Determine turnover

Using scrip wise :

Average Nifty Jan Fut buy: 200 Nifty Buy at 26,050

Average Nifty Jan Fut sell: 200 Nifty Sell at 26,075

Total profit/loss = 200 x Rs 25 = Profit of Rs 5,000 = Turnover of Nifty Jan Futures

Using trade wise :

100 Nifty Buy at 26,000, Sell at 26,100, Profit = Rs 10,000

100 Nifty Buy at 26,100, Sell at 26,050, Loss = Rs 5000

Turnover of Nifty Oct futures = Rs 10,000 + Rs 5000 (absolute sum of the loss) = Rs 15000

1. 100 Nifty Dec 26,000 puts bought at 1000 and sold at 950 on Dec 3 rd . Another 100 Nifty Dec 26,000 puts bought at 500 and sold at 480. Determine turnover

Using scrip wise:

Average of Nifty Dec 26,000 puts buy: 200 puts at 750

Average of Nifty Dec 26,000 puts sell: 200 puts at 715

Total profit/loss = 200 x Rs 35 = Loss of Rs 7,000

Total Turnover for Dec 26,000 puts = Rs 7,000

Using trade wise:

Trade 1

100 Nifty Dec puts bought at 1,000 and sold at 950, Loss = Rs 5,000

Turnover = Rs 5,000

Trade 2

100 Nifty Dec puts bought at 500 and sold at 480, Loss = Rs 2,000

Turnover = Rs 2,000

Total turnover = turnover of (trade 1+trade2) = Rs 7,000

Which of the methods scrip wise or trade wise should I follow?

Calculating turnover trade wise is the most compliant way of determining turnover. The tricky bit calculating trade wise turnover though is that  no broker (other than us at Zerodha)  currently offers trade wise turnover reports. All brokers provide a P&L with an average buy/sell price, which can be used to calculate scrip wise turnover. If you are not trading at Zerodha and are looking at calculating turnover trades, you will have to download all trades done during the year on an excel sheet and calculate turnover manually.

Here are the scrip wise and trade wise turnover reports on  Console

Once you determine the turnover, you will know if you need an audit or not, that is if a visit to a CA and have him verify your balance sheet and P&L statements is compulsory or not.




### 6.2 – Section 44AD

An audit is also required as discussed above if your profit is less than 6% of the turnover  and overall income is more than the basic exemption limit and you have opted out of presumptive taxations scheme . By turnover, I am referring to all business turnover (speculative, non-speculative, and any other business you have), and by profit, I am referring to only your net business profits (not including, salary, capital gains, and others). This means that if you are trading as a business and incur a loss, you will most likely have to get the books audited.

But an important thing to remember is that if your turnover is less than Rs 10 crore and if your profit is less than 6% of turnover an audit is not required if your total tax liability for the year is zero. That means if your total income (Salary + Business income + capital gain) is less than Rs 2.5lks (minimum tax slab in the old regime or Rs. 3lks in the new regime), you have no tax liability, and hence audit is not required. But it is advisable if losses are substantial to file the return with an audit.

Applying section 44AD for trading as a business income is causing a huge inconvenience for the retail trading community. Turnover in an ordinary business to turnover while trading on the markets is hugely different. Unlike an ordinary business where there is a fixed margin every time there is a transaction, in the business of trading there is no such guarantee. This section is an unnecessary burden that indirectly gets most small retail traders to have their books audited. We at Zerodha have petitioned to the government through this  campaign on Change.org , make sure to support it and also get your trading friends to do the same.

When you show trading as a business income, you will have to file using ITR3, which would mean that like any other business you are required to create and maintain –

- Balance Sheet
- P&L statement
- Books of Accounts

As discussed above, these will need to be audited based on your turnover (either turnover crosses the 10 Crore mark or in case the turnover is less than 10 Crore and your profits are less than 6% of the total turnover). Creating a balance sheet, P&L, and maintaining books of account is quite simple for individuals with just trading as a business income, it is explained below in brief.




### 6.3 – Balance sheet, P&L, Book of accounts

Balance sheet

A personal balance sheet provides an overall snapshot of your wealth at a specific period in time. It is a summary of your assets (what you own), your liabilities (what you owe), and your net worth (assets minus liabilities).

Creating a personal balance sheet  is fairly simple first pull together all of this information:

- Your latest bank statements
- Loan statement,
- House loan statement
- Personal loan statements
- Principal balance of any outstanding loans
- Demat holding statement

Once you have all of that information available, start developing your balance sheet by listing all of your assets (financial and tangible assets) with its respective values. Typical examples of the assets could be –

- Cash (in the bank, in hand, deposits with Bank)
- All investments (mutual funds, Shares, Debt investment )
- Property value ( Cost of Purchase + Duty any paid + Interiors etc)
- Automobile value ( Motor Car + Two-wheeler )
- Personal Property Value ( jewelry, household items, etc)
- Other assets ( Computers, Loans to friends, a plot of land, etc)

The sum of all of those values is the total value of your  assets .

Next, you can look at your liabilities, which should be everything you owe. Here are some common liability categories:

- Remaining mortgage balance (Loan Statement)
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Any other personal loans
- Credit card balances

The sum of all of the money you owe is your  liabilities.

The difference between your assets and your liabilities is your  net worth .

That’s it; this is your balance sheet. Instead of creating one at the end of every financial year, it probably makes sense to update once every few months.

Profit & Loss statement

Profit and loss will summarize your revenue streams and your expenses for the financial year.

To create your P&L for the given Financial Year, you will have to list down all revenues and expenses.

Revenue –

- Realized sale value from your stock holdings (Capital gains)
- The Income from F&O, Intraday, or Commodity Trades. (Speculative and non-speculative business income)

Remember that you can’t add your salary income (if you are working elsewhere) into your revenue stream on the P&L.

Expenses –

- Salaries, if you have people helping you trade.
- Rent, if you are using an office or any space for the trading activity for which you are paying a rental income
- Brokerage charges, taxes, and all other trade-related expenses.
- Advisory fees, consultancy, depreciation of computer, and etc (read the expenses section in the chapter on taxation-traders)

Revenue minus the Expense equals profit.

A  Balance sheet  helps you understand your networth between two dates and the  P&L  will give you the reasons why your networth went up or down in that period. Maintaining financial discipline is the key to long term personal wealth creation. A personal balance sheet and P&L will ensure that you are constantly in touch with reality – your assets and liabilities.

Book of accounts/Book-keeping

Maintaining a book of accounts and Book-keeping seem like very complex tasks, and typical reactions I have seen from traders is to get scared of the word and try postponing the decision to learn more on the topic. Again for an individual with only trading as a business income and/or salary, it is super simple- you just need to maintain two books.

Bank book : Take an excel download of all your bank statements, and make a note next to every entry to identify the nature of the transaction. It is also best to keep a copy of all the bills in case of expenses.

Trading book : This should be automatically getting maintained for you by the broker where you trade. The broker should be able to give you a P&L statement including all expenses for the year, ledger statement, and an online repository of contract notes if required. Unlike what many people think, contract notes aren’t really required unless scrutiny by the IT department, and even then if only asked for the same.

As a person who has traded with over 10 online brokers in India, the ledger and P&L statements with all expenses on it will show up any hidden charges by the broker.

At Zerodha,  we take great pride in the transparency we bring in as a business . Every charge other than brokerage is captured on the other credits/debits section on the tax P&L on Console. We also give you a summary with value of all your open option positions starting April 1 st  and closing March 31 st . This is extremely useful when you are trying to tally your ledger with your P&L statement.

We are almost done with the taxation module. The last chapter will have an explanation of what kind of ITR forms to use, and also an excel download of a sample ITR 4 form with all details as an easy reference.

1. Audit of the books is required if turnover is more than Rs 10 Crore mark
1. A udit of the books is required if one is opting out of presumptive scheme and FNO Income is less than 6% of the turnover and overall income is more than the basic exemption limit.
1. Turnover does not take into consideration the regular contract turnover
1. Turnover refers to the business turnover
1. Business turnover (for trading as a business) can be calculated scrip wise or trade wise
1. Trade wise turnover is the most compliant way of declaring turnover.
1. ITR3 requires you to have Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss statement along with books of account
1. Balance sheet equation states that Net worth = Assets – Liabilities
1. P&L statement details the revenues and expenses
1. If trading as a business maintaining 2 books of accounts becomes mandatory – Bank Book and Trade book
1. It is advisable to maintain and update the Balance Sheet, P&L, and books of accounts once in every quarter.

## 3.Classifying_Your_Market_Activity

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/classifying-your-market-activity/)



### 3.1 – Are you a trader or investor, or both?

Identifying yourself as a trader or an investor is the first step to filing your income tax returns.

You can decide on your own to show your stock investments as either capital gains or business income (trading), irrespective of the period of holding the listed shares and securities. Whatever stance you take, you will have to continue with the same in the subsequent years.

So, before filing income tax returns, you will have to first classify yourself as an investor, trader, or both.  We will, in this chapter, help you figure this out in line with what most Assessing Officers (AOs) would be expecting. By income, I mean both profits and losses.

When trading or investing, you need to classify your income under one of the following heads are –

1. Long-term capital gain (LTCG)
1. Short-term capital gain (STCG)
1. Speculative business income
1. Non-speculative business income
1. Dividend income

Let us understand what each of these means.

Long-term capital gain (LTCG)

Assume you buy stocks or Mutual Funds today for Rs.50,000/- and sell the same after 365 days at Rs.55,000/-, then the profit or gain of Rs.5,000/- is considered as a long-term capital gain. Generally speaking, gain or profit earned by investing in stocks or equity mutual funds and selling after 1 year from the date of purchase can be categorized under LTCG. Before the Union Budget announced in July 2024, in India, any gains realized and categorized as LTCG (equity & equity MF) were completely exempt from taxes for the first Rs 1lk and attracted a 10% LTCG tax if the gains for the year exceeded Rs 1lk. Do note that the purchase and sale of shares have to be conducted via a recognized exchange, meaning you should have paid STT.

From FY 2024-25 onwards, the Union Budegt increased the exemption of Rs 1 Lacs to Rs 1.25 Lacs, and long-term gains exceeding Rs 1,25,000 will be taxed as follows:

- If the sale occurred before July 23 rd , 2024, the tax rate is 10%
- If the sale occurs after July 23 rd , 2024, the tax rate is 12.5%

The threshold of Rs 1,25,000 applies to the total long-term capital gains for both periods (before and after July 23, 2024)

The above tax rates shall not apply if the investment and the consequent sale were made via an off-market transaction and not via a recognized stock exchange. Basically, you should have paid Securities Transaction Tax (STT).

For Unlisted stocks – Tax on LTCG of such shares is 20%  (after giving effect to indexation)  until FY 2023-24.  From FY 2024-25, tax on long-term capital gains will taxed :

- At 20% (with indexation) for sales made before July 23, 2024
- At 12.5% (without indexation) for sales made on or after July 23, 2024

Unlisted stocks are those company shares that are not listed or traded on any recognized stock exchange in India. Tax treatment of foreign shares will also be the same.

The Union Budget of 2018 introduced a grandfather clause that can reduce your LTCG tax liability. For all stocks held before 01 January 2018, the acquisition cost for the purpose of computing capital gains will be the higher of the actual purchase price or the maximum traded price on Jan 31st.

Assume you bought Infosys shares worth Rs.1,00,000/- in 2015, and they were worth Rs. 5,00,000 on 31st January 2018. If you sell those shares today for Rs. 20,00,000 today, your tax liability will be based on Rs. 15,00,000 (Rs. 20 lks – Rs. 5 lks), and not on Rs. 19,00,000 (Rs. 20 lks – Rs. 1 lk). If, however, the value of these shares on 31st January 2018 was less than your purchase price of 1,00,000, then you may consider your actual purchase cost for computing the LTCG tax applicable to you.

Short-term capital gain (STCG)

Assume you buy listed stocks or equity-oriented mutual funds today for Rs.50,000/- and sell them within the period of 12 months, say at Rs.55,000/-, then the profit or gain of Rs.5,000/- is taxed as a Short term capital gain (STCG).

Generally speaking, gain or profit earned by investing in stocks or equity mutual funds holding for more than 1 day (also called delivery-based) and selling them within 12 months from the date of purchase can be categorized under STCG.

Until FY 2023-24, the tax on STCG in India was flat at 15% on the gain or profit from the sale of shares or equity-oriented mutual funds.

From FY2024-25 onwards,  tax on short-term capital gains will be taxed as follows:

- At 15% for sales made before July 23, 2024
- At 20% for sales made on or after July 23, 2024

Therefore, if you buy Infosys shares worth Rs 100,000/- today and sell the same 10 days later for Rs.120,000/-, then you are liable to pay 15% on Rs 20,000 (STCG) or Rs 3000/- as taxes if sold before July 23 rd , 2024.

If you sell the shares after July 23rd, 2024, then you are liable to pay 20% on Rs 20,000 (STCG) or Rs 4000/- as taxes.

Speculative Business income

As per section 43(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, profits earned by trading equity or stocks for intraday or non-delivery are categorized under speculative  business income . Currency trading is also considered speculative since there is no STT (unless you are using currency derivatives to hedge).

There is no fixed rate like capital gains tax rate when you have a business income. If you have a business income, it has to be added to the rest of your other income and tax has to be paid as per the tax slab you fall in.

For example, assume my profit from trading intraday stocks was Rs. 100,000/- for the financial year and my salary was Rs. 800,000/-. So, my total income for the year is Rs 9,00,000, and I have to pay taxes on this as per my tax slab (new regime), Rs 40,000 in this case, as shown below.


SL No. | Slab | Taxable Amount | Tax Rate | Tax Amount
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 0 to Rs.300,000 | 300,000 | 0% | Nil
2 | 300,000 to 7,00,000 | 400,000 | 5% | 20,000
2 | 700,000 to 9,00,000 | 2,00,000 | 10% | 20,000
Total Tax applicable | Rs. 40,000


So, the point here is that one needs to club the speculative business income with other income sources and identify the taxable amount. Once this is done, the tax has to be paid based on the tax slab to which one belongs.

Non – speculative Business income

Income from trading futures & options on recognized exchanges (equity, commodity) is categorized under non-speculative business income as per section 43(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

As discussed earlier, business income has no fixed tax rate, you are required to add the non-speculative business income to all your other income, and pay taxes according to the slab applicable to you.

For example, assume a trader cum hotelier earns Rs 500,000 by trading F&O. Besides this, assume he also earns Rs.20,00,000/- from his hotel business. Therefore, his total income for the year is Rs 25,00,000/- (Rs.500,000 + Rs.20,00,000), and therefore, his tax obligation is as follows


Sl No. | Slab | Taxable Amount | Tax Rate | Tax Amount
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 0 to Rs.300,000 | 300,000 | 0% | Nil
2 | 3000,000 to 700,000 | 400,000 | 5% | 20,000
3 | 700,000 to 1,000,000 | 300,000 | 10% | 30,000
4 | 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 | 200,000 | 15% | 30,000
4 | 1,200,000 to 1,500,000 | 300,000 | 20% | 60,000
4 | 15,00,000 + | 1,000,000 | 30% | 300,000
Total Tax applicable | Rs.440,000


Effectively, the businessman here is paying 30% of his F&O profits as taxes.

You might wonder why trading equity intraday is considered ‘speculative,’ but trading F&O is considered ‘non-speculative.’

When trading intraday, there is no intention of taking delivery, and hence, it is considered a speculative business. F&O is defined as non-speculative by the government, maybe because it can be used for hedging and also for taking/giving delivery of the underlying contract.

Dividend Income

From FY2020-21 – Section 115BBDA of Income Tax was abolished, and Dividend incomes became taxable as per the applicable slab rates.

From 1st Oct 2024 onwards, any sum paid by a company (both listed and unlisted) for the buyback of its own shares will be treated as a dividend with no deduction allowed for expenses, including the cost of acquisition.

When the shareholder later sells other shares, you can claim the original cost of acquisition of all shares (including the bought-back shares).




### 3.2 – Pros and cons of declaring trading as a business income

Let us look at the bright side first; here is a list of advantages of declaring trading as a business income

1. Low tax  – If the total income (trading + any other) is less than Rs.300,000/-, then there is no tax implication (as per the new regime), and now, even if less than Rs.700,000/- effectively, one has to pay zero tax as you can avail a rebate if total income less than Rs 7lks.
1. Claim expense  – One can claim the benefit of all expenses incurred for the business of trading (while for capital gains, only charges on your contract note other than STT can be claimed). For example, brokerage charges, STT, other statutory taxes while trading, internet, phone, newspapers, depreciation of computers and electronics, research reports, books, advisory, etc.
1. Offset the loss with gains  – If one incurs any non-speculative F&O trading loss, this can be set off against any income other than salary. For example, if I incur a Rs 5,00,000 loss in trading F&O and my other income (like rent & interest, excluding salary) is Rs 10,00,000, I will have to pay tax only on Rs 5,00,000.
1. Carry forward the F&O loss  – If there is a net loss any year (non-speculative F&O + any income other than salary), and if income tax returns are filed before the due date, the loss can be carried forward for the next 8 years. During the next 8 years, this loss can be set off against any other business gain (non-speculative business income). For example, if you had a net loss of Rs 5,00,000 this year trading F&O, which was declared on time, you can carry forward this loss next year, and assuming you made a profit of Rs 20,00,000 next year, you can set off the previous year’s Rs 5,00,000 loss and pay taxes only on Rs 15,00,000.
1. Carry forward your intraday equity loss  – Any speculative or intraday equity trading loss can be set off only against any other speculative gain (note: you cannot set off intraday equity trading loss, which is considered speculative. with F&O trading, which is considered non-speculative).  Speculative losses can be carried forward for 4 years if the returns are filed on time. So, assume an equity intraday trader makes a loss of Rs.100,000/- this year; he cannot offset this against any other business income. However, he can carry it forward to the next year (up to 4 years). Assume the next year he makes a profit of Rs.50,000/- by trading equity intraday. Then, in that case, he can use the previous year’s Rs.100,000/- loss to offset the complete gains of this year (Rs.50,000). The balance loss of Rs.50,000/- can still be carried forward to the next 3 years. So do note that the partial offset of losses is possible.

The following table summarizes the above points –


Head of income under which Loss is incurred | Whether loss can be set- off within the same year | Whether Losses can be carried forward and set-off in subsequent years | Time limit for carry forward and set-off of losses
--- | --- | --- | ---
 | Under the same head | Under any other Head | Under the same head | Under any other Head | 
Losses of F&O as a Trader | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | 8 years
Speculation Business | Yes | No | Yes | No | 4 years
Capital Gain (Short-Term) | Yes | No | Yes | No | 8 years


Now, here is a set of drawbacks for declaring your business income –

1. Potentially high taxes  – If you fall under the 30% tax slab, you will effectively pay 30% of all your trading profits as taxes

1. ITR Forms  – Declaring business income would mean having to use an ITR3 or ITR 4, which would mean needing the help of a CA to file your IT returns. This can be an added effort and cost, especially for those salaried people who might have been using the very easy ITR 1 or ITR 2 (we will discuss more on this topic in the chapter on ITR forms).

1. Audit  – Having to maintain the book of accounts, which will need to be audited if your turnover goes above Rs 10 crore  (was Rs 1 crore until FY 19/20) for a year or if your profit is less than 6% of your turnover (we will discuss more on this topic in the chapter on Turnover)




### 3.3 – What are you? Trader, Investor, or Both?

Coming back to our original discussion, according to CBDT

Investor: anyone who invests with the intention of earning through dividends

Trader: anyone who buys and sells with the intention of profiting from the price rise.

As an investor, you can claim all your delivery-based equity gains/profit as capital gains. However, as a trader, it becomes your business income, which has its own pros and cons, as discussed above.

The rule is very clear with  respect to F&O trading and intraday equity trading . F&O trading has to be considered as a non-speculative business, and intraday equity as a speculative business. So, if you trade these instruments, you have to use ITR 3 to file IT returns. So even if you are salaried, you have to compulsorily use ITR3 and declare this income (profit or loss) from trading as a business.

Unlike what most people think, losses are also recommended to be  declared . Hiding trading activity on the exchange from the IT department could mean trouble, especially in case of any IT scrutiny (IT scrutiny is when the assessing income tax officer (AO) demands you to meet him and give an explanation on your IT returns). The chances of getting a call for scrutiny are higher when the IT department systems/algorithms pick up trading activity on your PAN, but the same is not declared on your ITR.

For  equity delivery-based investments , if you are holding stocks for more than a year, you would have received some kind of dividend, and even if you didn’t, you can show them all as investments and claim an exemption under the long-term capital gain. If you are  buying and selling stocks frequently  (yes, it is an open statement, but there is no rule that quantifies ‘frequent’) for shorter terms, it is best to declare that as non-speculative business income instead of STCG.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if investing/trading in the markets is your only source of income, and even if your trading activity is moderate, it is best to classify income from all your equity trades as business income instead of capital gains. On the other hand, if you are salaried or have some other business as your primary source of business, it becomes easier to show your equity trades as capital gains, even if the frequency is slightly higher.

Thankfully, you can be a trader and investor both at the same time. So, you can have stocks meant as an investment for the long term, and stocks meant for shorter-term trades. Just because you indulge in a lot of shorter-term trades wouldn’t necessarily convert all your long-term holdings or investments into trades and, therefore, bring those long-term gains under business income. However, it is important to clearly demarcate your trading and investment portfolio while filing returns.

Similarly, if you are trading F&O or intraday equity trading, you compulsorily have to classify yourself as a trader, but you can still show your long-term investments under the capital gains head to get the benefit of LTCG being exempt from taxes.

So, you can be an investor, trader, or both, but make sure to keep the above points in mind and  consult a chartered accountant before filing returns .

Even though this might seem confusing, rules are made for 1% of the population that is trying to break them. As long as your intent is right, you know the basic concerns of the IT department and keep those in mind while filing IT returns. It is quite simple. But stay consistent with the way you classify yourself, and don’t keep switching between being an investor or trader to declare your short-term equity trades.

If you follow these simple rules, let me assure you—you won’t need to fear the taxman.

Before we wrap this chapter, here are some interesting links that you should read through.

CBDT circular on the distinction between trades and investments.

Business Standard – Is your return from stocks capital gains or business income?

Economic Times – Are you a stock trader or an investor?

Taxguru – Income from share trading – Business or capital gain?

Moneycontrol- Investor or trader: The argument continues

Economic Times – Budget 2014 clarifies that commodity trading on recognized exchanges is non-speculative

Economic times – New data mining tool may access PAN-based information of taxpayers, help check evasion

1. Trading F&O (Equity, currency, commodity) is considered a non-speculative business
1. Trading intraday equity is considered a speculative business
1. Equity holdings for more than 1 year are considered long-term capital gain (LTCG)
1. Equity holdings between 1 day to 1 year with a low frequency of trades are considered short-term capital gain (STCG). In case of a high frequency of trades, it should be considered as non-speculative business income

### 2.1 – Overview

India needs help from all of us countrymen in developing a tax culture. The fear of the income tax department can be removed only by gaining knowledge of all the basic rules and regulations. Income tax rates in India have drastically reduced from over 90% in the early seventies to now (2020) where no tax has to be paid on annual income up to  Rs 3.0lks/2.5lks depending upon the regime opted . But the apathy of taxpayers towards filing income tax returns and paying taxes continues till today.

With the systems used by the IT department becoming sophisticated every year, the chances of repercussions in terms of notices and penalties due to non-filing, misfiling, and concealing information while filing your income tax returns (ITR) is going up significantly.

Similar to how Income-tax (IT) department has access to all your bank account details, they can also check up on all your capital market activity easily through the exchanges as they are all mapped to your PAN (Permanent account number). With AADHAR slowly getting linked everywhere the day isn’t far when the IT department will be able to send you a consolidated activity (income and expenses) statement, similar to how NSDL/CDSL sends for your holdings across all Demat accounts.

What we predicted long back has become a reality in the form of TIS (Taxpayer Information Summary) and AIS (Annual Information Summary). Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS) is an information category wise aggregated information summary for a taxpayer whereas AIS provides a detailed breakup of Income like savings account interest including post office interest, dividend, rent received, purchase and sale transactions of securities/immovable properties/crypto transactions, foreign remittances, interest on deposits, GST turnover etc.

Here is a specimen of TIS.

Check this notice received by a client who hadn’t declared his trading activity on commodity exchanges in FY 2012/13. The notice was sent only in 2015 asking for an explanation.  Check this link  that has a list of various codes in which these notices are sent by the IT department.

Also, e-campaigns are run where notices are sent to the taxpayers asking them to confirm the transactions undertaken.

Even if the intent is there to be compliant, most people including many Chartered Accountants (CAs) don’t understand the subject of taxation when investing & trading very well. We had put up a blog post, “ Taxation Simplified ” on Z-Connect many years back simplifying key aspects of taxation for market participants. We received a few thousand queries on that post. Answering all of them it was obvious that we had to do a lot more to simplify all aspects around taxation while trading or investing in the markets, hence this module.

If you only invest in stocks or mutual funds filing returns is quite simple, but can get tricky if trading intraday stocks or financial derivatives (futures and options).

We will in this module break all the concepts down into small easy to understand chapters without any of that jargon typically used by CA’s or tax consultants. Here is a sneak peek into what you can expect going forward in this module –

1. Introduction (Setting the Context)
1. Basics

### 2.2 – What is income tax?

It is a tax levied by the Government of India on the income of every person. The provisions governing the Income-tax Law are given in the Income-tax Act, 1961. In simpler words, Income Tax is a portion of the money that you earn paid to the government of India.

Why should I pay tax?

Yes, India does not offer social security and free medical facilities as being provided in some developed countries, but the government needs funds collected as taxes to discharge a number of responsibilities like Government hospitals, Education, National defense, Infrastructure development just to name a few.

Who is supposed to pay income tax?

Income-tax is to be paid by every person who earns more than the minimum income slab set by the government. The term ‘person’ as defined under the Income-tax Act covers in its ambit natural as well as artificial persons (including corporate).

Only 5 percent of over 130 crore population file income tax returns and only 1.5 crore Indians (<1%) pay any income tax. If you had to compare, over 45% of the population in a developed economy like the U.S.A pay taxes. Part of the reason for such an abysmally low number is also because many Indians don’t earn enough to qualify to pay income tax, but the larger factor has got to do with a lack of tax culture.

Taxes have to be paid based on how much income you earn every financial year. The financial year in India starts from April 1st and ends on 31st March. Do note that year can be specified either as a financial year (FY) or assessment Year (AY).

FY is used to denote the actual year the income was earned for which you are filing taxes. So, FY 2024/25 is the financial year starting April 1st, 2024, and ending 31st March 2025.

AY is used to denote the year in which you are supposed to file your taxes. So, AY 2025/26 is the year when you file the returns for income earned in FY 2024/25. So, AY 2025/26 and FY 2024/25 are one and the same. So, you will use ITR with AY 2025/26 on it to file your taxes for the income earned in the financial year starting April 1st, 2024, and ending 31st March 2025.




### 2.3 – Income tax slabs in India for financial year 2024/25

All Indians have to pay taxes on the total income earned every year as per the below tax slabs they belong to. You can choose to pay taxes based on the old or new regime.

Let’s first look at the old regime. If you are salaried, your employer would already be paying taxes on your behalf to the government and issuing you a ‘Form 16’ as an acknowledgment for having paid the taxes. Your employer will not have access to all your sources of income, like bank interest, capital gains, rental income, and others. You are supposed to use the form 16, add all your other income, calculate and pay any additional tax, and file your income tax returns before due date every year.

The tax slab for individuals (FY 24/25) is as below –

Individual (age up to 60 years)


Income slabs | Tax Rates
--- | ---
0 – Rs 2.5lks | NIL
Rs 2.5lks – Rs 5lks | 5% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 2.5lks.
Rs 5lks – Rs 10lks | Rs. 12,500 + 20% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 5lks
10lks and above | Rs. 112,500 + 30% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 10lks


Senior citizen (age 60 to 80 years)


Income slabs | Tax Rates
--- | ---
0 – Rs 3lks | NIL
Rs 3lks – Rs 5lks | 5% of amount by which income exceeds Rs 3lks.
Rs 5lks – Rs 10lks | Rs. 10,000 + 20% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 5lks
10lks and above | Rs. 110,000 + 30% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 10lks


Super senior citizen (age 80 years and above)


Income slabs | Tax Rates
--- | ---
0 – Rs 5 lks | NIL
Rs 5lks – Rs 10lks | 20% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 5lks
10lks and above | Rs. 100,000 + 30% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 10lks


A standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 is allowed in the computation of taxes. So, your actual taxable income is 50,000 less than your total income.

If total taxable income between Rs 2.5 to Rs 5lks, you can claim for the 5% tax rebate  up to Rs 12500/-  and effectively paying zero tax.

Surcharge for all the above age groups:  10% of income tax if income between Rs 50lks to Rs 1 crore. 15% if income between Rs 1 Crore to Rs 2 crores. 25% if income between Rs 2 crores to Rs 5 crores. 37% if it exceeds Rs 5 crores.

Surcharge of 25% and 37% is applicable on all incomes except Capital Gains and Dividend. Maximum surcharge on capital gains and dividend income is 15%.

Budget 2020 has introduced a new tax regime where the taxpayer has an option to decide either to pay taxes as per the above slabs claiming the various deductions (eg. Investment in ELSS, House rent allowance, etc) or let go of all deductions  except few deductions like 80CCD (2)  and opt-in for the below tax slabs. The highest surcharge rate of 37% on income above 5 Crores has been reduced to 25%.


Income slabs | Tax Rates
--- | ---
0 – Rs 2.5lks | NIL
Rs 2.5lks – Rs 5lks | 5% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 2.5lks.
Rs 5lks – Rs 7.5lks | Rs. 12,500 + 10% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 5lks
Rs 7.5lks – Rs 10lks | Rs. 37,500 + 15% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 7.5lks
Rs 10lks- Rs 12.5lks | Rs. 75,000 + 20% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 10lks
Rs 12.5lks- Rs 15lks | Rs. 1,25,000 + 25% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 12.5lks
Above 15lks | Rs. 187,500 + 30% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 15lks


In Budget 2023, the tax structure under the new regime was revised and is as follows:


Income slabs | Tax Rates
--- | ---
0-Rs3.0lks | NIL
Rs 3.0lks – Rs 6Lks | 5% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 3.0lks.
Rs 9.0lks – Rs 9Lks | Rs. 15,000 + 10% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 6lks
Rs 9.0lks – Rs 12lks | Rs. 45,000 + 15% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 9lks
Rs 12.0lks – Rs 15lks | Rs. 90,000 + 20% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 12lks
Above 15lks | Rs. 150,000 + 30% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 15lks


Further, In Budget 2024, the tax structure under the new regime was revised and is as follows:


Income slabs | Tax Rates
--- | ---
0-Rs3.0lks | NIL
Rs 3.0lks – Rs 7Lks | 5% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 3.0lks.
Rs 7.0lks – Rs 10Lks | Rs. 20,000 + 10% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 7lks
Rs 10.0lks – Rs 12lks | Rs. 50,000 + 15% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 10lks
Rs 12.0lks – Rs 15lks | Rs. 80,000 + 20% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 12lks
Above 15lks | Rs. 140,000 + 30% of the amount by which income exceeds Rs 15lks


A standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 is allowed in the computation of taxes. So, your actual taxable income is 75,000 less than your total income.

A rebate of Rs 25,000 is available if the taxable income is less than Rs 7 Lacs under the new regime, and it is available only to an individual who is a resident in India. Non-residents cannot claim the rebate.

The surcharge is the same as above.

Health and Education cess at 4% has to be computed on income tax plus surcharge, if applicable.

There is also a concept of marginal relief is designed to provide relaxation from levy of surcharge to a taxpayer where the total income exceeds marginally above Rs. 50 lakh, Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2 crore and Rs. 5 crore.

Thus, while computing the surcharge, if you have a total income of more than Rs. 50 lakh marginal relief shall be available in such a manner that the net amount payable as income tax and surcharge shall not exceed the total amount payable as income tax on total income of Rs. 50 lakh by more than the amount of income that exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. Sounded like a Bumrah bouncer!! Eh?

Let me explain: Dravid has a total income of Rs.51 Lakhs in an FY 2023-24, he will have to pay taxes inclusive of a surcharge of 10% on the tax computed i.e., total tax payable will be Rs. 14,76,750. But, if he had only earned Rs.50 lakhs, then the tax liability would have been Rs.13,12,500 only.

Isn’t it unfair for Dravid? For earning an extra Rs 1 Lacs, he will end up paying income tax of Rs.1,64,250. Dravid’s tax liability should be reduced to avoid any such excess tax payable.

The individual will get a marginal relief of the difference amount between the excess tax payable on higher income i.e. (Rs.14,76,750 minus Rs.13,12,500 = Rs.1,64,250) and the amount of income that exceeds Rs. 50 Lakhs i.e. (Rs.51,00,000 minus Rs.50,00,000 = Rs.1,00,000). The marginal relief will be Rs.64,250 (Rs.1,64,250 minus Rs.1,00,000). The wall saved Rs. 64,250 because of marginal relief.

From the next chapter, we will start focusing in detail on all aspects of taxation when trading and investing in the markets.

## 1.Introduction_(Setting_the_Context)

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/introduction-setting-the-context/)

I remember a time (maybe about 10 years ago) I had the opportunity to meet one of those hard to find Chartered Accountants who knew both taxation and markets quite well. It was at a friend’s party that I got introduced to him. He asked me what I do for a living, to which I promptly replied that I trade for a living. We immediately struck a chord and had a great conversation going. Somewhere during that engaging conversation, he asked me a few questions –

- How would I declare my Profits and/or Losses from my market activity?
- Do I bifurcate between speculative business income and non-speculative business income?
- Also, he asked me about the books of accounts that I’m supposed to maintain.

Thanks to my ignorance I had no answers to give him.

I was an eager learner, as I spent all my time learning about the markets and trading strategies but spent very little time learning about taxation and its relevance to market participants.

Probably the reason why I consciously ignored learning about taxation was that I always feared the heavy usage of jargon, random references to sections, subsections, circulars, and whatnot. To my defense – I once did honestly try to learn about taxation. I paid a visit to my broker’s office and met my dealer and questioned him on taxation. This is what he had to say – “Arre, why are you so worried? Long-term capital tax is 0% and short-term capital gains tax is 15%, that’s it, it is a simple matter.”

I for sure knew it was not just that, I insisted to meet someone more knowledgeable to understand the topic in greater detail. To my luck I got to meet the Regional Head of the stockbroking company, enthusiastically I picked his brains about taxation for market participants; unfortunately even he reiterated the same thing that my dealer had told me. It seemed even worse as the regional manager had a sense of pride while he gave me that sloppy answer.

Frustrated, I visited a CA and he essentially said the same thing that my dealer said, but he used fancy jargon and complicated the whole matter to no end. At that point in time, nobody had blogged about it online, no good articles were written on the topic, and thus my quest to learn taxation related to markets got squashed like a bug.

In retrospect, had I known more about this topic, had I got more information – I would have clearly benefited in multiple ways.

I’m certain there are many traders and investors in a similar situation as I was many years ago. In fact, this is true considering that our blog on taxation (which was put up a few years ago) has received over 10000 questions! This number is beside the numerous emails received and queries asked on Trading Q&A.

Keeping this in perspective, we are happy to introduce our new module on Zerodha Varsity aptly titled “Markets & Taxation”. The module deals with literally everything that you need to know about taxation related to markets – be it short term capital gains, or treating your intraday trades as speculative business income, or about Section 44AD & 44ADA – we have it all on Zerodha Varsity – in one place, concise, and simplified.

Now here is the best part – the whole module is authored by Nithin himself, which means that we get to learn about taxation from a trader/investor’s perspective and not really from the CA’s perspective. This makes a huge difference in terms of topic narrative. With a seasoned trader discussing taxation, we get to learn about the essential topics without digressing into the taxation wilderness.

Lastly, if I look back in time, I could not imagine brokers giving out such valuable information to clients. In fact, stockbrokers were always known to hoard information and pass it only to select clients. I’m sure you would agree with me on this, especially if you have been trading the Indian markets for a while now. Stock Brokers in India have always been snobby, expensive, and full of unwanted attitude.

However, the stockbroking industry is slowly waking up to the fact that the customer, irrespective of his size deserves the best. This change in attitude is leading to a revolution of sorts in the industry – and I do believe Zerodha is the epicenter of this revolution – changing the way the Indian broking industry functions. Be it providing you high-quality tools to trade, better trader education, or ready to use tax-friendly reports – Zerodha has it all for you.

So please do go ahead and explore this unique module on Markets & Taxation. I can assure you that the content presented here will make you more confident about matters related to taxation, and with that new-found confidence, you will never have to fear the taxman!

Stay connected, stay profitable.

## 4.Taxation_for_Investors

[Read more](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/taxation-for-investors/)



### 4.1 – Quick recap

In continuation of the previous chapter:  Classifying your market activity

The income tax department allows you to decide whether to show your stock investments as capital gains or a business income (trading), irrespective of the period of holding the listed shares and securities. Whatever stance you take, you will have to continue with the same in the subsequent years. Check this  circular .

Simply put,

1. Stocks that you hold for more than 1 year can be considered investments as you would have most likely received some dividends and also held for a longish time
1. Shorter-term equity delivery buy/sells can be considered investments as long as the frequency of such buy/sell is low.
1. If you wish, you can also show your equity delivery trades as a business income, but whatever stance you take, you should continue with it in the future years as well.

This chapter focuses on investing; hence, we will keep the discussion limited to points 1 and 2. In the next chapter, we will discuss taxation when trading/business income.




### 4.2 – Long term capital gains (LTCG)

Firstly, you need to know that when you buy & sell (long trades) or sell & buy (short trades) stocks within a single trading day, then such transactions are called intraday equity/stock trades. Alternatively, if you buy stocks/equity and wait till it gets delivered to your DEMAT account before selling it, then it is called ‘equity delivery-based’ transactions.

Any gain or profit earned through equity delivery-based trades or mutual funds can be categorized under capital gains, which can be subdivided into:

- Long-term capital gain (LTCG) : equity delivery-based investments where the holding period is more than 1 year
- Short-term capital gain (STCG):  equity delivery-based investments where the holding period is less than 1 year

Taxes on long-term capital gains for equity and mutual funds are discussed below –

For stocks/equity –  0% for first Rs 1lk and @10% exceeding Rs 1lk

0% for first Rs  1.25 l akhs and long-term gains exceeding Rs 1.25 Lakhs will be  taxed as follows:

- If the sale occurred before July 23rd, 2024, the tax rate is 10%
- If the sale occurs after July 23rd, 2024, the tax rate is 12.5%

The threshold of Rs 1,25,000 applies to the total long term capital gains for both periods (before and after July 23, 2024).

The above taxation rate is only if the transactions (buy/sells) are executed on recognized stock exchanges where STT (Security transaction tax) is paid. As discussed above, LTCG is a holding period of more than 1 year.

If the transactions (buy/sells) are executed through off-market transfer where shares are transferred from one person to another via delivery instruction booklet and not via a recognized exchange by paying STT, then LTCG is 20% in case of both listed and non-listed stocks (Listed are those which trade on recognized exchanges). Do note that when you carry an off-market transaction Security Transaction Tax (STT) is not paid, but you end up paying higher capital gains tax.

Note that a gift from a relative through DIS slip is not considered as a transaction and hence not capital gain. It is important that gift not be treated as transfer, and relative could be (i) spouse of the individual (ii) brother or sister of the individual (iii) brother or sister of the spouse of the individual(iv) brother or sister of either of the parents of the individual (v) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the individual(vi) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the spouse of the individual (vii) spouse of the person referred to in clauses (ii) to (vi).

For equity mutual funds (MF) –  0% for first Rs  1.25 lakhs and long-term gains exceeding Rs 1.25 Lakhs will be taxed as follows:

- If the sale occurred before July 23rd, 2024, the tax rate is 10%
- If the sale occurs after July 23rd, 2024, the tax rate is 12.5%

Similar to equity delivery based trades, any gain in investment in equity-oriented mutual funds for more than 1 year is considered as LTCG and exempt from taxes up to Rs 1lk per year. A mutual fund is considered as equity-oriented if at least 65% of the investible funds are deployed into equity or shares of domestic companies.

For non-equity oriented/Debt MF –  taxed as per slab rates.

Union budget 2014 brought in a major change to non-equity mutual funds. As opposed to 1 year in equity-based funds, you have to stay invested for 3 years in non-equity/debt funds for the investment to be considered as long-term capital gain. If you sell the funds within 3 years to realize profits, then that gain is considered as STCG.

Note:  The government, in the Finance Bill 2023, made certain amendments that apply to debt funds that invest not more than 35% in equity shares in Indian companies. As per the new rules, these mutual funds and ETFs will not be eligible for indexation benefits and will be taxed at applicable slab rates, for investments made on or after April 1, 2023.

For Cryptocurrencies/Virtual Digital Assets –  flat 30% on the gains.

Budget 2022 introduced taxation on Cryptocurrencies (VDA). Gains from Cryptocurrencies are taxed at a flat rate of 30%. No deduction is allowed except for the cost of acquisition. The tax rate is the same for both long-term capital gains and short-term capital gains.




### 4.3 – Indexation

Indexation helps adjust the effect of inflation on your purchase price.

If you are wondering what inflation is, here is a simple example to help you understand –

All else equal, if a box of sweets was priced at Rs.100 last year, chances are the same could cost Rs.110 this year. The price differential is attributable to inflation, which in this example is 10%. Inflation is the percentage by which the purchasing value of your money diminishes.

Indexation determines the true net gains on the sale of an  asset after considering the effect of inflation .

Until FY2023-24, you could get an indexation benefit to determine your  net capital gains  on non-equity-oriented mutual funds, property, gold, and others where you are taxed on LTCG. The Union Budget 2024 eliminated the need for indexation on all investments except for the real estate investments made before 23 July 2024, the day the budget was announced. So, if you are making long-term capital gains on a property bought before the budget day, you have the option to pay an LTCG tax of either 20% with indexation (old regime) or 12.5% (new regime) without indexation.

How can you apply indexation to the purchase price of your real estate asset? Or how can you find the indexed purchase price of your asset? You can use the  Cost inflation index (CII),  which can be found on the  income tax website.

Let’s understand indexation and evaluate the old and new regimes using the purchase/sale of an apartment as an example.

Purchase value:  Rs.10,00,000/-

Year of purchase: 2015

Sale value: Rs 30,00,000

Year of sale: 2025

Long-term capital gain: Rs 20,00,000/-

Without indexation in the new regime, I will have to pay an LTCG tax of 12.5% on the capital gains of Rs 20,00,000/-, which works out to Rs 2,50,000/-.

Under the old regime, the 20% LTCG tax on an asset’s indexed purchase value can be computed as follows.

Firstly, calculate the indexed purchase value. We need to use the cost inflation index (CII) for that. Find below the  cost inflation index from the income tax website until  2024/25.  Refer to this  for CII data before 2001/02.


Financial Year | CII
--- | ---
2001-02 | 100
2002-03 | 105
2003-04 | 109
2004-05 | 113
2005-06 | 117
2006-07 | 122
2007-08 | 129
2008-09 | 137
2009-10 | 148
2010-11 | 167
2011-12 | 184
2012-13 | 200
2013-14 | 220
2014-15 | 240
2015-16 | 254
2016-17 | 264
2017-18 | 272
2018-19 | 280
2019-20 | 289
2020-21 | 301
2021-22 | 317
2022-23 | 331
2023-24 | 348
2024-25 | 363


Going back to the above example,

CII in the year of purchase (2015): 240

CII in the year of sale (2025): 363

Indexed purchase value = Purchase value * (CII for the year of sale/ CII for the year of purchase)

So –

Indexed purchase value = Rs 10,00,000 * (363/240)

= Rs 15,12,500

Long term capital gain = Sale value – Indexed purchase value

Therefore, in our example

LTCG = Rs 30,00,000 – Rs 15,12,500

= Rs 14,87,500/-

So the tax now would be 20% of Rs 14,87,500 = Rs 2,97,500, which is more than the Rs 2,50,000/- that you will pay under the new regime. In this example, you would most likely choose to pay the LTCG tax under the new regime. However, there can be instances when the old regime might result in a lower tax outgo for you.

You don’t have to calculate the indexed purchase value of your real estate manually. You could use the IT department’s  Cost inflation index utility  for that.




### 4.4 – Short term capital gain (STCG)

Tax on short  term capital gains for equity and mutual funds are discussed below –

For stocks/equity  – 20% of the gain for shares sold after 23 July 2024.

It is  20%  of the gain if the transactions (buy/sells) are executed  after 23 rd  July 24  and  15% if executed before 23 rd  July 24  on recognized stock exchanges where STT (Security transaction tax) is paid. STCG is applicable for holding period over 1 day and not more than 12 months.

If the transactions (buy/sells) are executed via off-market transfer (where shares are transferred from one person to another via delivery instruction booklet and not on the exchange) where STT is not paid, STCG will be taxable as per your applicable tax slab rate. For example, if you are earning over Rs.15,00,000/- per year in salary, you will fall in the 30% slab, and hence STCG will also be taxed at 30%. Also, STCG is applicable only when the income exceeds a minimum tax slab of Rs 2.5lks/year if you have opted for the old regime and a minimum tax slab of Rs. 3lks/year if you have opted for the new regime. So if there is no other income for the year and assuming there was Rs 1lk STCG, it would not entail the flat 20% tax.

For equity mutual funds (MF)  – 20% of the gain if sold after 23rd July 24 and 15% if sold before 23rd July 24

Similar to STCG for equity delivery-based trades, any gain in investment in equity-oriented mutual funds held for less than 1 year is considered STCG and taxed at 15% of the gain. Do note that a fund is considered equity-based if 65% of the funds are invested in domestic companies.

For non-equity oriented/Debt MF: As per your individual tax slab

Union budget 2014 brought in a major change to non-equity mutual funds. You have to now stay invested for 2 years for the investment to be considered as long-term capital gain. All gains made on investments in such funds held for less than 2 years are now considered as STCG. STCG, in this case, has to be added to your other business income and tax paid according to your income tax slab.

For example, if you are earning around Rs 800,000/- per year in your normal business/salary and you had STCG of Rs 100,000/- from debt funds, you will fall in the 20% slab as your total income is Rs 9,00,000/-. So effectively, in this example, you will pay 20% of STCG as taxes.

For non-equity oriented/Debt MF  – flat 30% on the gains.

Budget 2022 introduced taxation on Cryptocurrencies (VDA). Gains from Cryptocurrencies are taxed at a flat rate of 30%. No deduction is allowed except for the cost of acquisition. The tax rate is the same for both long-term capital gains and short-term capital gains.




### 4.5 – Days of holding

For an investor, the taxation difference between LTCG and STCG is quite huge. If you sold stocks 360 days from when you had bought, you would have to pay 15% of all gains as taxes on STCG. The same stock if held for 5 days more (1 year or 365 days), the entire gain would be exempt from taxation as it would be LTCG now.

It becomes imperative that you as an investor keep a tab on the number of days since you purchased your stock holdings. If you have purchased the same stock multiple times during the holding period, then the period will be determined using FIFO (First in First out) method.

Let me explain –

Assume on 10 th  April 2014, you bought 100 shares of Reliance at Rs.800 per share, and on June 1 st,  2014 another 100 shares were bought at Rs.820 per share.

A year later, on May 1 st,  2015, you sold 150 shares at 920.

Following FIFO guidelines, 100 shares bought on 10 th  April 2014 and 50 shares from the 100 bought on June 1 st,  2014 should be considered as being sold.

Hence, for shares bought on 10 th  April 2014 gains = Rs 120 (920-800) x 100 = Rs 12,000/- (LTCG and hence 0 tax).

For shares bought on June 1 st , Gain = Rs 100 (920-820) x 50 = Rs 5,000/- (STCG and hence 15% tax).

Small little sales pitch here 🙂 – if you are trading at Zerodha the holdings page in our back office platform called  Console  will keep a tab for you on a number of days since your holdings were purchased, and even a breakdown if bought in multiple trades.

Here is a snapshot of the same –

The highlights show –

1. Day counter
1. A green arrow signifying holdings more than 365 days, selling which won’t attract any taxes.
1. If you have bought the same holdings in multiple trades, the split up showing the same.

Besides Zerodha Q, equity tax P&L is probably the only report offered by an Indian brokerage which gives you a complete breakdown of speculative income, STCG, and LTCG.




### 4.6 – Quick note on STT, Advance Tax, and more

STT (Securities Transaction Tax) is a tax payable to the government of India on trades executed on recognized stock exchanges. The tax is not applicable to off-market transactions which are when shares are transferred from one DEMAT to another through delivery instruction slips instead of routing the trades via exchange. But off-market transactions attract higher capital gains tax as explained previously. The current rate of STT for equity delivery based trades is 0.1% of the trade value.

When calculating taxes on capital gains, STT can’t be added to the cost of acquisition or sale of shares/stocks/equity. Whereas brokerage and all other charges (which include exchange charges, SEBI charges, stamp duty, service tax) that you pay when buying/selling shares on the exchange can be added to the cost of share, hence indirectly taking benefit of these expenses that you incur.

Advance tax when you have realized capital gains (STCG)

Every taxpayer with business income or with realized (profit booked) short term capital gains is required to pay advance tax on 15 th  June, 15 th  Sept, 15 th  December, and 15 th  March. Advance tax is paid keeping in mind an approximate income and taxes that you would have to pay on your business and capital gain income by the end of the year. You as an individual are required to pay 15% of the expected annual tax that you are likely to pay for that financial year by 15 th  June, 45% by 15 th  Sept, 75% by 15 th  Dec, and 100% by 15 th  March. Not paying would entail a penalty of annualized interest of around 12% for the period by which it was delayed.

When you are investing in the stock markets, it is very tough to extrapolate the capital gain (STCG) or profit that will be earned by selling shares for an entire year just based on STCG earned for a small period of time. So if you have sold shares and are sitting on profits (STCG), it is best to pay advance tax only on that profit which is booked until now. Even if you eventually end up making a profit for the entire year which is lesser than for what you had paid advance tax, you can claim for a tax refund. Tax refunds are processed in quick time by the IT department now.

You can make your advance tax payments online by clicking on  Challan No./ITNS 280  on  https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/ .

Which ITR form to use

You can declare capital gains either on ITR 2 or ITR3

ITR3 (ITR 4 until 2017): When you have business income and capital gains

ITR 2: When you have a salary and capital gains or just capital gains




### 4.7 – Short and long-term capital losses

We pay 15% tax on short term capital gains and 0% on long term capital gains, what if these were not gains but net losses for the year.

Short-term capital losses, if filed within time, can be carried forward for 8 consecutive years and set off against any gains made in those years. For example, if the net short-term capital loss for this year is Rs.100,000/-, this can be carried forward to next year, and if the net short-term capital gain next year is Rs.50,000/- then 15% of this gain need not be paid as taxes because this gain can be set off against the loss which was carried forward. We will still be left with Rs Rs.50,000 (Rs.100,000 – Rs.50,000) loss which is carried forward for another 7 years.

Long-term capital losses can now (post introduction of LTCG tax@10%) also be set off against long-term gains.

Long-term capital loss can be set off only against long-term capital gain. Short-term capital loss can be set off against both long-term gains and short-term gains.

Losses incurred in crypto cannot be offset against any income, including gains from cryptocurrency and such loss shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent assessment years.
